# X-Ray Project Screenshots and Documentation

This folder contains **visual documentation, exported reports, and project overview PDFs** related to the **50 chest X-ray mass lesion detection dataset**.  
It provides step-by-step visual and textual references for the **annotation process**, **data verification**, and **format exports** from the CVAT annotation environment.

---

## 🩻 Project Context

- **Modality:** X-Ray (Chest Radiography)  
- **Primary Task:** Mass Lesion Detection (Bounding Box Annotation)  
- **Annotation Tool:** [CVAT – Computer Vision Annotation Tool](https://cvat.org/)  
- **Total Annotated Images:** 50  
- **Export Formats:** COCO, CSV, Pascal VOC, YOLO

## 🧩 File Descriptions

| File | Purpose |
|------|----------|
| **01_project_overview.pdf** | Summarizes the project’s scope, dataset design, and annotation goals. |
| **02_raw_data_preannotation_preview.pdf** | Shows raw image samples before annotation and label class configuration in CVAT. |
| **03_annotated_sample_data.pdf** | Displays examples of chest X-ray images after bounding box annotation (mass lesions). |
| **04_export_settings_and_data.pdf** | Documents export parameters, data validation results, and structure of final output formats. |
| **screenshots_png_images/** | Contains individual screenshots from CVAT (image-by-image visual verification). |

## 🖼️ Screenshot Contents

Each `.png` file within `screenshots_png_images/` visually confirms:
1. Proper label placement (`mass_lesion`).
2. Bounding box accuracy (no overlap or background noise).
3. Dataset consistency between raw and annotated data.
4. Export validation steps across COCO, CSV, VOC, and YOLO.

These images act as **visual audit evidence** for dataset creation.

---

## 💡 Use Cases

- **Research Documentation:** To demonstrate dataset creation steps in medical AI studies.  
- **Quality Control:** Verifies annotation precision before model training.  
- **Presentation:** Ideal for GitHub pages, academic posters, or dataset publication previews.  
- **Training Reference:** Can be used to teach annotation standards for radiology datasets.
