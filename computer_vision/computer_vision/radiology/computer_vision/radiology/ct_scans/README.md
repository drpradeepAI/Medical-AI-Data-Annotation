# ðŸ§  CT Scan Annotation Dataset â€“ Medical AI (Brain Tumor Segmentation)

This folder contains a **curated medical imaging dataset** for **CT scanâ€“based brain tumor segmentation and annotation**.  
It is part of the larger **Medical AI Data Annotation** repository focused on developing structured, high-quality datasets for training and validating deep-learning models in medical imaging.

---

## ðŸ“˜ Overview
This dataset module demonstrates an end-to-end medical annotation workflow covering:
- **Raw CT brain images**
- **Multiple annotation export formats (COCO, YOLO, CVAT XML, Segmentation Masks)**
- **Supporting documentation and screenshots**
- **Metadata describing dataset organization and specifications**

It is designed to showcase **data quality, reproducibility, and transparency** for AI-driven medical research.

## ðŸ“‚ Subfolders Explained

### 1. `raw_data/`
Contains the **original 50 CT brain images** used for segmentation and labeling.  
Both the uncompressed image folder and the zipped collection are available for convenience.

### 2. `annotated_data/`
Includes four industry-standard export formats:
- **COCO (.json):** Standard object detection/segmentation structure  
- **YOLO (.txt):** Lightweight bounding-box and mask coordinates per image  
- **CVAT XML:** Compatible with CVAT re-imports or other XML-based pipelines  
- **Segmentation Masks:** Pixel-wise labeled masks for tumor region classification  

Each format has its own folder with documentation and `.keep` files to maintain structure.

### 3. `metadata/`
Provides dataset summary information (image counts, formats, labels, and version details).  
Acts as a **dataset descriptor** for researchers and clients to understand structure at a glance.

### 4. `screenshots/`
Holds **visual documentation** of the annotation pipeline â€” project setup, labeling interface, and export settings â€” as both **PNG images** and **PDF summaries**.

## ðŸ§  Use Cases
This dataset is ideal for:
- Demonstrating **medical imaging annotation workflows**
- Benchmarking segmentation models (U-Net, Mask R-CNN, DeepLab)
- Creating tutorials for **CVAT and AI dataset preparation**
- Serving as a **portfolio project** for computer-vision freelancing in healthcare AI

## ðŸ§© Future Additions
- Add `metadata.csv` and `metadata.json` for automated dataset parsing  
- Introduce new annotation samples (lung CT, chest CT, abdominal scans)  
- Include preprocessing scripts for normalization and mask generation
