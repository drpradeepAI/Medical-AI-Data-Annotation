## 🧠 Purpose

This section of the repository serves as a **visual guide** and **progress log** for dataset contributors and reviewers.  
It helps users quickly understand:
- How MRI scans were annotated  
- The formats used (COCO, YOLO, CVAT XML, Segmentation Mask)  
- The export settings applied in the CVAT tool  
- Sample outputs for verification and training readiness
