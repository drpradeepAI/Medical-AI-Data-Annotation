## 🧩 Dataset Architecture  

Each annotation project maintains a **consistent folder hierarchy** to ensure transparency, standardization, and automation compatibility.

{Project_Name}/
├── raw_data/ # Original de-identified medical images
├── annotated_data/ # Labeled files (COCO, YOLO, CVAT, Mask)
├── metadata/ # Dataset descriptors, schema, mappings
├── screenshots/ # Visual documentation (annotation proofs)
└── README.md # Dataset-level documentation

This structure is compatible with training pipelines from **MONAI**, **Detectron2**, **YOLOv8**, and **PyTorch Medical Imaging Libraries**.
