# 👁️ Computer Vision — Medical Image Annotation Suite

This section of the **Medical-AI-Data-Annotation** repository focuses on **image-based medical data annotation** — covering radiology, pathology, and diagnostic imaging datasets.

All datasets are created, curated, and annotated under medical supervision by an **MBBS Doctor**, ensuring clinical accuracy and adherence to ethical data preparation standards.

## 🩻 Overview

| Focus Area | Description |
|-------------|-------------|
| 🧠 **Radiology Datasets** | CT, MRI, and X-ray image datasets annotated for disease localization and segmentation. |
| 🧫 **Pathology Datasets** *(Upcoming)* | Microscopic pathology and histopathology image annotations. |
| 🦴 **Orthopedic Imaging** *(Planned)* | Skeletal and joint X-ray datasets annotated for fracture classification. |
| 🩸 **Ultrasound Imaging** *(Planned)* | Ultrasound image annotation datasets for soft tissue and cardiac abnormalities. |

## ⚙️ Annotation Standards

All computer vision projects follow a **unified image annotation framework**, ensuring consistency across imaging modalities and dataset types.

| Parameter | Specification |
|------------|---------------|
| **Annotation Tools** | CVAT, Label Studio, Roboflow, MakeSense.ai |
| **Annotation Types** | Bounding Boxes, Semantic Segmentation, Polygon Masks, Keypoints |
| **Formats Supported** | Pascal VOC, COCO, YOLO, CVAT XML, PNG Masks |
| **Data Source** | Public and synthetic medical image repositories (de-identified) |
| **Quality Control** | Physician-led validation of bounding accuracy and class consistency |
| **Language & Metadata** | English labels; structured metadata per study |

## 🧩 Dataset Architecture

Each image annotation project is organized systematically to ensure transparency and reproducibility:

Project_Name/
├── raw_images/ # Original unannotated medical images
├── annotated_data/ # Annotations (COCO, VOC, YOLO, CVAT, PNG masks)
├── metadata/ # Image-level metadata (e.g., modality, diagnosis, resolution)
├── screenshots/ # Proof of annotation or dataset visualization
├── label_schema/ # Class label configuration (JSON)
└── README.md # Project documentation and instructions

---

## 🧠 Applications

These datasets are designed to support:
- 🩻 **Disease Detection & Localization** (e.g., pneumonia, tumor, fracture)
- 🧩 **Segmentation Tasks** (e.g., organ, lesion, or tissue boundary extraction)
- ⚙️ **Computer-Aided Diagnosis (CAD) Model Training**
- 🔍 **Cross-Modality Learning** with text (paired with NLP datasets)
- 📊 **Dataset Benchmarking & Transfer Learning**

## 🌐 Integration Within Repository

This folder is part of a larger integrated system for AI-based medical data annotation:

| Domain | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| 🧠 [`Natural_Language_Processing`](../Natural_Language_Processing/) | Text-based annotation of EHRs, reports, and clinical notes. |
| 👁️ `computer_vision/` | Image-based annotation of radiology and pathology data. |
| 🔗 *(Planned)* `multimodal/` | Unified text–image medical datasets for multimodal AI research. |
