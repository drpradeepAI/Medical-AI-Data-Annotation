# 🧠 Natural Language Processing (NLP) — Medical Text Annotation Suite

This section of the **Medical-AI-Data-Annotation** repository focuses on **Natural Language Processing (NLP)** projects applied to **medical text data** — including clinical case notes, radiology reports, pathology summaries, and other health-related narratives.

All datasets are manually curated and annotated by a **medical professional (MBBS Doctor)** using standardized schemas for **AI/ML model development, healthcare analytics, and NLP research**.

---

## 📘 Overview

| Focus Area | Description |
|-------------|--------------|
| 🩺 **Clinical EHR Case Notes** | Annotation of electronic health record (EHR) narratives from admission to discharge. |
| 🧫 **Pathology Text Reports** *(Upcoming)* | Biomedical text annotation from histopathology and lab findings. |
| 🩻 **Radiology Reports** *(Upcoming)* | Structured text annotation from diagnostic imaging interpretations. |
| 🧬 **Genomic & Laboratory Data** *(Planned)* | NLP-ready text datasets of genomic and biochemical summaries. |

---

## ⚙️ Annotation Standards

All NLP projects follow a **unified and reusable pipeline**, ensuring cross-domain consistency.

| Parameter | Description |
|------------|--------------|
| **Annotation Tool** | Doccano (v1.x) |
| **Annotation Type** | Named Entity Recognition (NER) |
| **Schema Used** | 36 predefined medical entity labels (`label_config_36_final.json`) |
| **File Formats** | JSON, JSONL, CSV |
| **Language** | English |
| **Data Source** | Synthetic and anonymized real-world-style medical texts |
| **PII Handling** | All personally identifiable information removed before annotation |

## 🧩 Dataset Architecture

Each NLP dataset follows a **standard internal structure**, designed for clarity and reproducibility:

Project_Name/
├── raw_data/ # Unannotated source text
├── annotated_data/ # Final Doccano exports (JSON/JSONL)
├── label_schema/ # 36-label schema for medical NER
├── metadata/ # Case-level metadata files (CSV, JSON)
├── screenshots/ # Workflow evidence and visual docs
└── README.md # Project-specific documentation

This consistent hierarchy allows easy integration into ML pipelines and ensures future projects can align seamlessly.
