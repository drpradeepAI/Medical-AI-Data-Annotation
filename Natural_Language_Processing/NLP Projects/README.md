# 🧠 NLP Projects — Medical Text Annotation for AI and Research

This section of the **Medical-AI-Data-Annotation** repository hosts all projects focused on **Natural Language Processing (NLP)** involving **clinical, pathological, and radiological medical text**.

Each project represents a specialized dataset designed and annotated by a **medical professional (MBBS Doctor)** for use in **AI model training, medical NLP research, and healthcare data intelligence**.

## 📘 Overview

| Category | Description |
|-----------|--------------|
| 🩺 **Clinical Case Notes (EHRs)** | Manually annotated Electronic Health Records (EHRs) across specialties such as cardiology, neurology, and pulmonology. |
| 🧫 **Pathology Reports** *(Upcoming)* | Text-based pathology and biopsy reports annotated for entity extraction and diagnosis classification. |
| 🩻 **Radiology Reports** *(Upcoming)* | Structured annotation of radiological narratives (X-ray, CT, MRI) for NLP-based interpretation and multimodal integration. |
| 🧬 **Genomic & Lab Reports** *(Planned)* | Annotated biomedical text covering genetic and biochemical test results. |
