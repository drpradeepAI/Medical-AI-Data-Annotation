# üß© Label Schema ‚Äî 36-Label Configuration for Cardiology EHR Annotation

This folder contains the **Doccano label configuration file** used during manual annotation of **20 cardiology Electronic Health Record (EHR)** case notes.  
The schema defines a standardized set of **36 medical entity labels** with assigned colors, shortcuts, and categories ‚Äî ensuring annotation consistency, reproducibility, and cross-specialty compatibility.

## üìÅ File Description

| File Name | Description |
|------------|--------------|
| `20cardio_case_label_config_36_in_json.json` | Doccano-compatible configuration file defining 36 medical entity labels, their color mappings, and shortcut keys for efficient tagging. |

---

## üß† Purpose

The label configuration file was imported into **[Doccano](https://github.com/doccano/doccano)** before annotation to establish a consistent annotation protocol.  
It enables:
- Uniform entity definitions across annotators  
- Schema portability for future **multi-specialty clinical NLP projects**  
- Simplified re-annotation and model retraining
