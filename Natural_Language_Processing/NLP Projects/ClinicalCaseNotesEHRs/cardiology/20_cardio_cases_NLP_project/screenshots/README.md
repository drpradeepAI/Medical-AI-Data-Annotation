## 🧠 Workflow Summary

The annotation process followed this structured pipeline:

1. **Project Setup** — Creating a new Doccano project and importing raw data.  
2. **Raw Data Review** — Inspecting unannotated cardiology case texts.  
3. **Pre-Annotation Phase** — Ensuring data readiness and quality checks.  
4. **Label Schema Integration** — Importing standardized 36-label schema.  
5. **Annotation Phase** — Manual entity tagging by medical expert.  
6. **Export & Verification** — Exporting annotated data and performing quality validation.
