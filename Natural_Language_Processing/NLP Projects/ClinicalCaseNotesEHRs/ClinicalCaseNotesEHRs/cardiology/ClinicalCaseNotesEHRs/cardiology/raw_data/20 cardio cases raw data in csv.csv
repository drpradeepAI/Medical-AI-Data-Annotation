History of Present Illness:
Briefly, pt is a 49yo man with h/o EtOH abuse who was found down
in cardiac arrest by his wife at home. EMS was called, who noted
PEA and initiated CPR. He was unable to be intubated in the
field, so he was taken to the closest ED. There CPR was
continued and after a fourth round of epinephrine, cardiac
rhythm became VT/VF, for which he was shocked into sinus
tachycardia with a pulse. He was intubated, and when OG tube was
placed 6+ liters of bright red blood were suctioned from his
upper GI tract. Labs there were significant for anemia and
thrombocytopenia, acute renal failure, metabolic acidosis (pH
6.80), elevated CK with evidence of myocardial infarction, liver
failure, and coagulopathy. He was resuscitated with blood
products including PRBCs and FFP, in addition to IV fluids with
lactated ringers and normal saline, as well as vasopressor
support with Levophed. He developed hyperkalemia and required
calcium gluconate and bicarbonate. Once he was stabilized,
transfer to [**Hospital1 18**] MICU was arranged, and we were consulted for
possible upper endoscopy to assess variceal hemorrhage and for
probable placement of [**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **] tube.
.
On arrival to the floor, SBP dropped to the 60s, requiring
additional vasopressor support, blood products, and IV fluid
resuscitation.

Brief Hospital Course:
#) GI Bleed/Hypovolemic Shock: Upon arriving to the MICU, the
patient was started on a massive transfusion protocol.
Including the pt's time at the OSH and on transport, the patient
received a total of 15 units of pRBCs (7 here), 10 units of FFP
(4 here), and 2 units of cryoprecipitate here.  The patient also
received Vitamin K on transfer, and received 1 unit of platelets
here at [**Hospital1 18**].  His blood pressure was supported with maximum
doses of levophed, neosynephrine, and vasopressin.  He was also
bolused with NS to help support his pressure.

#) Hyperkalemia: This was secondary to the profound time he was
down and his acidosis.  He was treated with insulin and D50 x 2
at [**Hospital1 18**], and x 2 during transport.  He was also given 2 amps of
CaCl, had 4g of Calcium gluconate, and also received CaCl on
transport.  His tele was monitored which showed QRS widening,
however no peaked T waves.

#) Metabolic acidosis: Pt had a profound lactic acidosis [**1-24**]
down time.  His lactate was in the 50s at the OSH, and this came
down to the upper teens with hydration here.

#) Renal failure: Pt had a Cr of 2.9 upon admission to the MICU.

Chief Complaint:
Unresponsive, cardiac arrest

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
CPR, intubation

History of Present Illness:
87 year old man with a history of CAD s/p MI and stent, bladder
carcinoma in situ, who presents from nursing home found to be
unresponsive and found to be in cardiac arrest. Per collateral
history, he was receiving treatment for a UTI with ciprofloxacin
and azithromycin but otherwise in his usual state of health when
he was found to be unresponsive this morning at his nursing
home. EMS was called and CPR was initiated in the field. An
intraosseous line was placed and he was intubated and CPR was
initiated. CPR was continued for 30 minutes with one round of
ACLS achieved at nursing home. He arrived to the ED undergoing
chest compressions.
.
In the ED, he was found to have a pH 6.94/83/329, and lactate of
14.6, and HCT of 19.7, INR of 3.7, PLTs of 47. A nonsterile
femoral line was placed. 2 chest tubes were placed bilaterally
for emperic PTX treatment. A bedside echo was done by cardiology
which was apparently unremarkable. He was given 1gm epinephrine
boluses 7 times, 2 amps of sodium bicarbonate, and was started
on a levophed gtt, dopamine gtt, neosynephrine gtt, and
epinephrine gtt, and he was given 3L of NS, and 1 unit of blood
hanging. He lost his pulse twice, second time at 1115 but
responded to one last round of epi, making a total of 8 rounds.
His last set of vitals 130/90 HR 80s 100% on vent 15, FIO2 100%,
PEEP 5, Rate of 20.
.
In the MICU, he arrives intubated, sedated and with a pulse. His
initial vitals were BP 107/40, HR 60. Given the patient's
advanced age, lactate of 14.6, pH of 6.94, tenous blood
pressures despite 4 pressors, the MICU team has decided to not
escalate care and deem his code status as DNR/DNI as CPR is not
indicated. He was given 3L of NS, 2 unit of PRBCs.

Brief Hospital Course:
87 year old man with a history of CAD s/p MI and stent, bladder
carcinoma in situ, who presents from nursing home found to be
unresponsive and found to be in cardiac arrest.  Most likely
etiology of PEA was hypovolemic blood loss given presenting HCT
of 19.7 which is 20 points down from baseline (down from 37 on
[**2155-6-17**] per nsg home records). Would consider blood loss from
bladder CA/hematuria history, vs occult GI bleed. Consider QT
prolongation from recent cipro vs aspiration PNA/hypoxia as
other etiologies. Patient initially with an extremely poor
prognosis, with a lactate of 14.6, pH of 6.94, on four pressors
and MAPs of 50s, incompatible with life and consistent with
diffuse cell death.  Urgent family meeting was held and decision
was made to make the patient DNR/DNI.  He expired shortly
thereafter with family at bedside.  Patient's PCP was [**Name (NI) 653**].

Brief Hospital Course:
On arrival to MICU, she was noted to be persistently hypotensive
despite max levophed.  Started on vasopressin followed by
escalating neosynephrine.  With severe metabolic acidosis
6.76/58/76 with lacate peak at 14.2, given 2 amps bicarb
followed by bicarb drip.  Also given FFP given severe
coagulopathy and concern for bleed (hct down to 18.4 from
baseline ~30s).  In setting of blood products with worsening
oxygenation with desaturations to 85% on FiO2 100%, PEEP 15. The
patient was continued on three pressors for blood pressure
support and her BP still remained low.

The health care proxy was called to bedside. The patient was s/p
cardiac arrest and in DIC, unable to be cooled. She remained
hypotensive despite maximal pressors. After discussions with the
housestaff and attending physician, [**Name10 (NameIs) **] health care proxy did
not wish to further escalate care and made the patient DNR. The
patient died of PEA cardiac arrest with her HCP at her side.

The case was referred to the medical examiner, however, the
medical examiner declined the case. The family did not want an
autopsy.

History of Present Illness:
Mr. [**Known lastname **] is a 76 year old gentleman with a PMH significant
for DM 2, HTN, and hyperlipidemia transferred from an OSH after
cardiac arrest. The patient initially presented to an OSH last
night after a witnessed cardiac arrest whiel eating dinner.
Bystander CPR was performed and EMS arrived 14 minutes after
receiving the initial 911 call.  Per EMS report, patient was in
PEA with unknown rate on application of AED.  Atropine, 1 mg
1:10,000 epi, 100 mg lidocaine bolus followed by infusion were
given pre-hospital, and the patient was intubated.
Approximately 7 minutes after EMS arrival on-scene, the patient
was noted to be in VF and was defibrillated with 360 J with ROSC
with sinus rythmn.
.
Upon arrival to the OSH ([**Hospital3 **]), the patient was noted
to be in a sinus rhythmn.  Overnight, he required levophed for
hypotension that was weaned off this morning, and was also noted
to be bradycardic to the 40s, and received an IV amiodarone load
and heparin gtt.  He was also noted to have a rectal temperature
of 100 degrees, and remained unresponsive off sedation.  A
non-contrast CTH was negative for acute intracranial process and
a CTA chest was negative for pulmonary emboli.
.
Of note, the patient recently presented to the [**Hospital1 18**] ED with
chest pain and unilateral leg swelling. Due to an elevated
d-dimer, a CTA was performed that was negative for PE.  The
patient then had an ETT that was negative (6.7 METS, 13 minutes
on [**Doctor Last Name 4001**] protocol) and was discharged home.
.
Currently, the patient is intubated and unresponsive.
.
Complete ROS and cardiac ROS unobtainable as patient is

with bystander CPR performed.  Per report, at the OSH patient
was initially warmed at the OSH, and 24 hours post-arrest he has
a GCS <5, which has a poor prognostic value.  Discussed with
cardiac arrest team, no indication for cooling. The etiology of
Mr. [**Known lastname **] cardiac arrest is not completely clear, and the
differential includeda acute myocardial ischemic event,
arrythmia, and pulmonary embolus. An ischemic event seems less
likely given trends in the patients cardiac biomarkers. During
his stay at [**Hospital3 **], Mr. [**Known lastname **] was unresponsive, did not
follow commands, and did not demonstrate any cortical cerebral
function.  A neurology evaluation with EEG also demonstrated no
cortical function. After discussion with the family about the
patient's grim prognosis without hope for significant recovery
from a persistent vegetative state, the family agreed to have
the patient extubated. Mr. [**Known lastname **] [**Last Name (Titles) **] shortly thereafter
on [**2163-8-12**].

Ms [**Known lastname 107532**] is an 81 year old woman with past medical history
significant for chronic low back pain, coronary artery disease,
hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and question of vasculitis,
transferred to medicine from PACU after undergoing bronchoscopy
for workup or a right lower lobe mass and developing a new
oxygen requirement.
.
Briefly, Ms [**Known lastname 107532**] began having a chronic cough and some
hemoptysis this past [**Month (only) **]. Workup for this included a CT
scan, which revealed a large (6cm) cavitary lesion. She
underwent extensive evaluation for possible metastatic disease
including head MRI, PetCT and bronchoscopy, however although Pet
revealed markedly FDG avid
right lower lobe mass with a satellite nodule, transbronchial
biopsy and washings were non diagnostic. Patient was electively
admitted today to have repeat rigid bronchoscopy with FNA of
lymph nodes under ultrasound guidance. Patient was extubated
without difficulty however she remained hypoxic and is still
requiring supplemental oxygen.
.
Patient denies any pain, but reports being slightly disoriented
still. Has a heavy cough and reports some difficulty breathing,
no nausea.
.
In the PACU, 137/68 96 93% on 50% face tent. Patient was given

Brief Hospital Course:
# Respiratory Distress: Initial respiratory distress was thought
to be likely a result of post-bronchoscopy fluid overload. No
pneumothorax seen. Patient initially did well on oxygen by
facemask with diuresis, but on [**3-22**] patient had increased
respiratory distress associated with ventricular tachycardia,
and was intubated for hypoxic respiratory failure. Patient
initially received empirical levaquin for presumed CAP, but
antimicrobials were empirically broadened to Vanco/Cefepime on
[**3-22**]. BAL during bronchoscopy on [**3-22**] was unremarkable. She was
extubated the following day, but had respiratory distress again
on [**3-25**] requiring reintubation. She was transferred to the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**]
where her respiratory status improved with diuresis and
antibitiocs transiently but ultimately she could not be weaned
from the Vent. Several family meetings were held during the
course of her hospitalization, and with lack of progress and
continued dependence on mechanical ventialtion, consistent with
the patients previsously expressed wishes that long term
mechanical ventilation was not acceptable quality of life, she
was terminally extubated.
.
# Ventricular Tachycardia. Possibly triggered by
hypoxia/respiratory distress. 4 episodes over ~30 minutes which
responded to amiodarone (150 x 2 and then 0.5 mg/min drip) and
respiratory support. Was intubated and started on amiodarone
drip with no more episodes. She did not require DC
cardioversion. Completed amiodarone drip but continued to have
NSVT, which resolved following repositioning of a central venous
catheter on [**3-26**].

# RLL mass: Squamous cell on bronch biopsy. Patient was
transferred to the [**Hospital Ward Name **] on [**3-25**] for radiation therapy.
RadOnc deferred therapy.
.
# NSTEMI/CAD: Ruled in by troponin (peaked at 0.25) on [**3-22**] with
flat CK. Started on heparin drip until troponin plateaud. TTE
showed anterior wall motion abnormalities and depressed EF with
MR 2+. Cardiology deferred cath given her overall status.

# CHF: has known diastolic CHF. Presented to [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] with florid
pulmonary edema and effusions. This was related to new, acute
systolic dysfunction from anterior NSTEMI compounded by 2+MR
.
# Hypercalcemia: Albumin only 2.2 so corrected calcium actually
>12. With appropriately low PTH this is likely from malignancy
related tumor factors. Patient received lasix and pamidronate. .

History of Present Illness:
63yo F with h/o smoking, pulmonary HTN diagnosed in [**2189**],
transfered from [**Hospital1 18**] [**Location (un) 620**] for futher workup of pulmonary HTN
including R heart catheterization. Pt states she was in her
usual state of health when polycythemia was noted on her labs at
annual physical exam in [**Month (only) 547**] or [**2189-5-24**], leading to a
workup in which she was diagnosed with pulmonary HTN. She had
noted some dyspnea on exertion prior to that time but was
generally active and not bothered by her symptoms, which she
associated with her past smoking history. PFTs showed moderate
obstructive airway disease with severely reduced DLCO; CT showed
apical bullous emphysema as well as basilar pulmonary fibrosis.
In [**8-/2189**], she reports starting home O2 that she has required
constantly since then. She reports starting Spiriva and
Symbicort around that time. Her condition worsened subacutely in
[**12/2189**], when she was found to have low blood pressure at an
outpatient visit and admitted to the hospital for a week.
She was readmitted about 3 weeks ago with 3-4 days of worsening
dyspnea and some lethargy. On admission, she had a WBC of 15 on
prednisone and was on 3L O2 with a sat of 76%. Her sat improved
on CPAP, although it was difficult for her to tolerate. She was
treated for a possible PNA with antibiotics
levofloxacin/vancomycin (completed 14 day course) and also
received solumedrol. Her sats have usually been 91-93% on a 50%
venti mask, although she desats with anxiety. She was treated
with an insulin sliding scale for new hyperglycemia in the
setting of steroids. She received diltiazem during the admission
but it was held [**2-23**] for SBP 80s which responded to a 500 cc
bolus. Pt had an episode of urinary retention, with placement of
a foley 3 days ago.
Pt reports sore throat, nasal congestion, and cough productive
of sputum that was initially dark brown (weeks ago) and is now
yellowish. She denies pleuritic chest pain, fevers/chills, and
palpitations although she notes occasional panic attacks.

CXR [**2190-2-24**]
Small contiguous thick septated radiolucency seen at the bases
consistent with pulmonary fibrosis. Larger pattern of
radiolucency is seen in
the upper lung fields consistent with emphysema. Pulmonary
vasculature and
interstitium is consistent with heart failure. Prominence of
pulmonary artery
is consistent with pulmonary hypertension.

Brief Hospital Course:
Ms. [**Known lastname **] is a 63y/o lady with pulmonary hypertension of
unknown etiology, with subacute worsening of her dyspnea, who
was transfered after 3 week admission to [**Hospital1 18**] [**Location (un) 620**] for
further workup of pulmonary HTN.  She had increasing O2
requirements and complained of worsening dyspnea throughout her
stay.  She was uncomfortable lying flat, and did not undergo
right-heart catheterization.  She eventually required 100% NRB,
and then non-invasive ventilation with PEEP and 100% FiO2 in
order to maintain oxygenation.  Her labs and ABGs suggested
respiratory fatigue and systemic ischemia (rising lactate;
antibiotics were started in case this represented sepsis).  A
family meeting was held with the patient and her family; she had
a significant risk of mortality from CPR and intubation, and
might possibly never be able to be weaned from a ventilator in
the setting of her bad emphysema, pulmonary fibrosis, and
pulmonary hypertension.  Patient and family decided to decline
intubation and her management was shifted towards
comfort-focused care.  She expired with family at the bedside.

Brief Hospital Course:
63 yo male with history of HTN, HL, and claudication who
presents after carotid stenting for monitoring.

# Carotid stenting - The patient tolerated the procedure well.
Post procedure, the patient was hypotensive and bradycardic to
the 40s.  He was started on dopamine and transferred to the CCU
for monitoring.  The dopamine drip was able to be weaned after
one night and the patient's blood pressure rose to 120s without
any medication.  He ambulated around the unit without difficulty
and tolerated PO intake well.  He was started on a full dose
aspirin.  Plavix and statin were continued.  Lisinopril and
amlodipine were held due to hypotension.

# Smoking cessation - The patient said he was trying to cut back
his smoking habit.  He was counseled that smoking cessation
would be the best thing to do to lower his stroke risk.

[**Known lastname **]. Please review past discharge summary for details, but
briefly she had GI bleed from AVMs, dabigatran stopped,
readmitted with ischemic colitis, managed conservatively. She
was relatively hypotensive during her last admission. She was
always very clear about her wishes to avoid invasive measures
including central lines. At rehab, she was noted to be
hypoxemic. CXR with e/o CHF. Started on lasix gtt. Difficulty
with hypotension. Also had right calf pain and dvt ruled out by
ultrasound. She was admitted here for work-up. In emergency
department, was started on dopamine for hypotension. On arrival,
discussed with patient and niece at bedside. She stated she
wanted to be made comfortable. She stated that she did not want
medicine to raise her blood pressure and was made CMO.

Patient was transferred to [**Hospital Ward Name 121**] 7 from the MICU accompanied by
her niece, and palliative care physicians (Dr. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **]

Chief Complaint:
elective ASD closure

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
ASD closure


History of Present Illness:
50 year old Cantonese speaking male with no cardiac history,
found to have an ASD that is now s/p closure with amplatz device
on [**2153-8-29**], admitted to the CCU for post-procedure monitoring. He
reported a history of dyspnea for the last year, as well as
chest pain over the last 6 months. CT and echo demonstrated a
large ASD with dilated RV and moderate dilation of RA and LA.
PA pressures were reported to be normal.  On [**2153-8-17**] the patient
underwent cardiac catheterization.  He was found to have normal
coronary arteries, an RA of 6 mmHG, RV of 25/7 mmHG, PA pressure
of 25/10 mmHG, mean PA pressure of 17 mmHG, wedge of 10 mmHG.
O2 sat measurements were consistent with left to right shunting.
He was admitted this AM for elective ASD closure with 3D TEE
guidance.
.
His procedure this AM was relatively uncomplicated, however the
closure device was difficult to seat in the septal defect, so
there was some concern for possible migration or embolization
with valsalva or other large changes in pressure.  He is
therefore admitted to the CCU for post-procedure monitoring.
.
On arrival to the floor, patient is extubated but very sleepy
and frequently apneic.  He denies pain or discomfort.

TTE: [**2153-8-30**]:
A septal occluder device is seen across the interatrial septum.
The device abuts the aortic root on both sides, but does not
directly imponge on it. Regional left ventricular wall motion is
normal. Overall left ventricular systolic function is normal
(LVEF>55%). The right ventricular cavity is mildly dilated with
mild global free wall hypokinesis. The aortic valve leaflets (3)
appear structurally normal with good leaflet excursion and no
aortic stenosis. Trace aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral
valve appears structurally normal with trivial mitral
regurgitation. The estimated pulmonary artery systolic pressure
is normal. There is no pericardial effusion.
.
IMPRESSION: Atrial septal occluder in place without significant
residual flow by color Doppler. Trace aortic regurgitation.

Brief Hospital Course:
50 year old Cantonese speaking male with no cardiac history,
found to have an ASD that is now s/p closure with amplatzer
device on [**2153-8-29**] without any complcations.
.
# ASD Closure:  Patient had symtpoms of shortness of breath and
chest discomfort for the past 6 months.  TTE and CT chest showed
dilated RV and RA, a large secundum ASD (2.1 cm. Cath showed no
angiographically CAD, his right sided pressures were normal with
Qp/Qs of 2.4, therefore he was considered a good candicate for
ASD closure.  Patient had closure of ASD with amplatzer device
without any complcaitions however closure device was difficult
to seat in the septal defect therefore he was admitted for
monitoring in the CCU.  During his short CCU stay patient did
not have any chest pain, shortness of breath or any other
symptoms.  His cath site remained clean and dry without any
bleeding. He did however have occasional central apnea during
sleep right after being extubated which resolved after few
hours. Follow up TTE showed the amplazter device in place
without any shunting.  During this hospitalization he was
started on aspirin x1 year and plavix x 3 months. He was also
adviced to avoid any heavy lifting for the next 3 months to
prevent displamcement of the closure device.

dysfunction with akinesis of the mid and distal segments of the
inferior, inferolateral and lateral walls, as well as anterior
wall, septum and apex (basal segments of the anterior septum,
inferolateral wall and anterior wall are best preserved).
Overall LVEF = 15-20%. There is no ventricular septal defect.
Right ventricular chamber size is normal with moderate global
free wall hypokinesis. No aortic regurgitation is seen. The
mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Mild (1+) mitral
regurgitation is seen. There is at least mild pulmonary artery
systolic hypertension (may be underestimated, given uncertainty
about right atrial pressure). There is no pericardial effusion.

IMPRESSION: Severe regional left ventricular systolic
dysfunction, c/w multivessel CAD. Moderate right ventricular
systolic dysfunction. At least mild pulmonary hypertension.

Brief Hospital Course:
50 yo male with h/o HCV presented with NSTEMI.

NSTEMI:  Patient initially went to the cath lab where he was
found to have LAD chronically occluded (mid) and LCX mid segment
with thrombus (assumed culprit lesion).  Balloon angioplasty was
attempted secondary to low platelets (didn't want to give stent
requiring antiplatelet therapy) but with suboptimal results;
ultimately a bare metal stent was placed.  RCA was patent but
could not be fully engaged; origin may be anomalous.  He
received heparin during procedure (started at OSH).  LVEDP was
elevated, but this was attributed to large dye load while trying
to visualize RCA.  Bivalirudin gtt was started after the
procedure.  ASA and plavix were continued
.
After the catheterization, patient was admitted to [**Hospital Unit Name 196**]. About
30-60 minutes after arrival on the floor, he complained of
recurrent chest pain, nausea, back pain. SBP was initially in
the 100s on arrival on the floor but then dropped to the 80s
then 70s. Patient was given IVF bolus. He then vomitted, became
unconscious, and went into PEA arrest. CPR was started. He was
given epinephrine 1 mg. Pulses returned. Patient regained
consciousness, again vomited coffee-ground emesis. He was
intubated. Started on dopamine and wide-open IVF. Transferred to
CCU. ECG showed new ST depression in precordial leads and ST
elevations in II, III. R-sided ECG showed ST elevations in
lateral leads.  He was taken back to the cath lab where stent
was found to be patent.
.
In the ccu, the patient continued to be in tachycarda to the
120s and 130s and hypotensive, with falling urine output despite
pRBC and multiple fluid boluses.  There was concern for
retroperitoneal hemorrhage post-catheterization, and CT abdomen
without contrast was done which did not show evidence of such. A
pulmonary artery catheter was placed for monitorring.  Shortly
after placement, patient was bradycardic to the 40s, thought to
be secondary to vagal stimulation from the catheter.  He
received atropine with return of sinus tachycardia briefly,
followed by junctional bradycardia.  His blood pressure then
fell to the 40s.  CPR was initiated, and epinephrine given.  He
was also treated for hyperkalemia with insulin, glucose, and
calcium.  Echo showed no evidence of effusion or tamponade.
Bradycardia and hypotension worsened and the patient became
asystolic.  The patient expired.
.
# PUMP: No known h/o diastolic/systolic function, had elevated
LVEDP in Cath lab. Echo showed hypokinesis and LVEF 15-20% with
severe regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction and
akinesis of the mid and distal segments of the inferior,
inferolateral and lateral walls, as well as anterior wall,
septum and apex.
.
# [**Name (NI) 1867**] Pt with plts 57. His hepatologist was
contact[**Name (NI) **] who stated that thrombocytopenia was secondary to
recent interferon therapy and was at recent baseline.
.
# HCV and GI bleed: Patient had a history of HCV. LFTs mildly
elevated, T.bili WNL; pt has completed IFN/ribavarin and per
report recent viral load undetectable. Per hepatologist, patient
did not have a history of known varices.  However, given his
coffee ground emesis and subsequent dark brown fluid from
gastric suction, GI was consulted.

in the pancreas seen. He was referred for [**Date Range **] on [**2155-4-17**] but
the procedure was not tolerated well. He was brought back to
[**Date Range **] to be done under general anesthesia on [**2155-4-18**]. The
procedure showed irregular malignant appearing high grade
stricture in the distal CBD measuring 1.5 cm. Sphincterotomy and
biliary stent placement were done. Cytology brushings were
taken. In the PACU he developed acute shortness of breath and
hypoxia. Heart rates were 100-114. Per notes, he had mild wheeze
and bronchial breath sounds. He was intubated with
etomidate/succinylcholine. Vital signs post-intubation were
112/67 87 100%RA. He dropped his blood pressure requiring
neosynephrine gtt.

Pertinent Results:
see attached lab results and [**Name (NI) **] report

[**Name (NI) **]:
Impression: 1.Normal major papilla
2.Cannulation of the biliary duct was performed with a
sphincterotome using a free-hand technique.
3.Cholangiogram showed a irregular malignant appearing high
grade stricture in the distal CBD measuring 1.5 cm. The bile
duct proximal to the stricture appeared dilated.
4.A sphincterotomy was performed in the 12 o'clock position
using a sphincterotome over an existing guidewire.
5.Cytology samples were obtained for histology using a brush at
the CBD stricture.
6.A 7cm by 10F Cotton [**Doctor Last Name **] biliary stent was placed
successfully across the biliary stricture.

MICRO:
Stool- c diff negative x 3
All cultures without growth

Cytology of biliary stricture: atypical cells

Brief Hospital Course:
1)Biliary obstruction:  Resolved with [**Doctor Last Name **] placement of stent.
Obstruction appears malignant, concerning for possible
pancreatic v cholangiocarcinoma.  Cytology inconclusive but CA
[**65**]-9  elevated.  GI team is concerned that pt would not likely
tolerate more aggressive biopsy.  They are considering doing an
endoscopic ultrasound with biopsy in the future and will take
further brushings which they discuss with daughters.
--- Follow up [**Year (2 digits) **] for biliary stent change in [**Month (only) **], scheduled

2)Hypoxic respiratory failure: Required intubation after [**Month (only) **].
Cause undetermined, no h/o CHF but some improvement with nebs
and diurese.  Pt also had episodes of rapid AF and so it was
considered that possibly this had caused acute CHF or aspiration
give occurred just after [**Month (only) **].  Continue nebs, on corgard for
many years at home.  CXR without pneumonia, did  have small b/l
pleural effusions. Was in the ICU, extubated [**2155-4-21**].

3)AF: Pt has been on corgard for many years which he asked to
continue rather than lopressor which was suggested.  Coumadin
restarted [**4-23**] at his home dose.  This needs to be held for one
week prior to [**Month (only) **] [**Month (only) **].

4)Hypotension / Shock: This occured shortly after [**Month (only) **] and resp
failure requiring intubation.  Sepsis was considered given [**Month (only) **]
manipulation.  Cultures neg, course of levofloxacin and flagyl.


5) Loose stool:   3 sets c. diff toxin negative.

.
# Mobitz II 2nd degree heart block:  The patient reports DOE
over the last last 6 months.  The patient saw her cardiologist
and underwent holter monitoring.  It revealed  2nd degree heart
block (Mobitz II), and the patient was admitted for pacemaker
placement.  Admission ECG showed 3:1 AV block.  The patient had
pacer pad placed and atropine at the bedside.  She underwent
pacemaker placement on [**2140-7-15**] and received pre/post doses of
vancomycin.  Additionally, she was continued on 3 days of
keflex.  She had a CXR that did not reveal PTX and pacer leads
in proper position.  The patient underwent ECHO that did not
show effusion and EF of 70%. The patient tolerated the procedure
and was discharged with device clinic follow-up in 1 week.

# Coronaries: The patient with no hx of CAD. She was continued
on ASA 81 for primary prevention.

# PUMP: The patient underwent ECHo that showed EF 70%.  The
paitent had no signs of CHF and remained euvolemic.

# Hypertension: The patient with no prior history of HTN.  SHe
did have several episodes of hypertension with SBP in the 150's.
 This could be due to pain post-procedure or undiagnosed HTN.
However, she did also have several measurements with SBP <120.
Therefore, no medication were initiated.  The patient should
have outpatient follow-up with her PCP.

Brief Hospital Course:
62 year old woman with COPD, asthma, ?CHF (on Lasix at home), on
home O2 2L NC admitted intubated and ventilated from OSH with
acute on chronic respiratory failure from the day of her
admission likely [**12-23**] to COPD exacerbation. The patient was
intubated and ventilated at OSH prior to transfer to our
institution. ABG on admission was consistent with acute on
chronic respiratory acidosis. She is on 2L nasal canula at home.
Acute respiratory failure was attributable to pneumonia, COPD
exacerbation and fluid overload from CHF exacerbation. CXR
showed possible bilateral effusions and basilar infiltrates. TTE
showed normal to hyperdynamic EF with diastolic dysfunction.
STREPTOCOCCUS PNEUMONIAE grew in sputum. Patient was initially
treated with Levofloxacin + Ceftriaxone + Vancomycin and then
only oral Levaquin. She was covered for Influenza with Tamiflu
for 3 days until she ruled out per nasal swab. Patient was
extubated on day 2 of admission, following extubation she had
some hypoxia which improved with IV Lasix 40 mg (acute diastolic
heart failure). She was subsequently started on her home dose of
Lasix 40 mg [**Hospital1 **]. Patient was additionally treated with a course
of prednisone as well as Albuterol and Ipratropium nebs and
Advair 250/50 1 puff [**Hospital1 **]. She had abdominal/inguinal superficial
skin infection which appeared fungal and improved markedly with
topical treatment. She had hypotension on admission was from
sedation agents. AM cortisol was elevated, ruling out adrenal
insufficiency. Levophed was weaned quickly without any need for
pressors since AM of [**1-6**]. She had RLE edema: from chronic
lymphedema without recurrent cellulitis. No evidence of DVT on
U/S. She was discharged home on [**12-24**] L of oxygen without rales or
wheezing.

Brief Hospital Course:
This is a 79 yo F with h/o hypertension, CVA in [**2131**] with
residual left-sided weakness, epilepsy and Afib on Couamdin, who
now presents with weakness and found to have Hct drop who
subsequently developed hypoxic respiratory failure.
.
# Anemia: Unclear if anemia was acute or subacute. It is
presumably related to GI blood loss since she was guaiac
positive, however, could also be Fe def [**2-12**] poor nutrition.
Hemolysis labs negative. She was satrted on PPI drip then
transitioned to PPI IV BID. GI was consulted and planned to
scope her once INR trended down. She received 2 units PRBCs.
.
# Lethargy/generalized weakness: Unclear etiology but most
likely secondary to hypovolemia and anemia. Throughtou her
hosptial course, however, she never became interactive or alert
as she develoepd profound hypoxemia. Hypernatremia likely also
contributed to lethargy.
.
#. Hypoxic hypercarbic respiratory failure: Pt wasinitially 97%
on RA on arrival to MICU but became progressively more hypoxic.
She had witnessed aspiration event on [**2-15**] and CXR was consistent
with bilateral airspace opacities and likely pulmonary edema. We
attempted to diurese her but she did not respond to lasix up to
80mg IV and was not awake enough to tolerate BiPap. She became
more lethargic and unresponsive and was not effectively
ventilating. ABG was 7.20/67/62 on 100% NRB. Given her
progressive decline and her wishes to be DNR/DNI, her family was
contact[**Name (NI) **] and she was made [**Name (NI) 3225**]. They were at her bedside when
she expired at 2:05am on [**2144-2-17**]. Progressive hypoxic respiratory
failure was attributed to development of pulmonary edema or
TRALI related to blood transfusions or ARDS/[**Doctor Last Name **] related to
aspiration event.
.
# Diarrhea: likely viral etiology but has h/o c diff
- check c diff, stool studies
.
# Afib: Warfarin held and she was given FFP given
supratherapeutic INR.
.
# Seizure d/o:  Phenytoin level monitored
.

CXR [**2163-6-21**]
FINDINGS: No previous images. Obliquity of the patient makes it
difficult to
evaluate mediastinal structures. However, the single frontal
view shows no
definite tracheal abnormality. Cardiac silhouette is somewhat
prominent and
there is indistinctness of pulmonary vessels suggesting some
elevated
pulmonary venous pressure. No acute focal pneumonia.

IMPRESSION:
Soft tissue density projecting over and obscuring the bilateral
valleculae and
epiglottis. The differential diagnosis is broad. The finding may
be amenable
to direct endoscopic inspection. Alternatively, MRI of the neck
could be
obtained for further evaluation.


Brief Hospital Course:
Pt is an 81 y/o F with a long history of angioedema, known
difficult airway, and hx of tracheostomy in [**2163-2-22**] after
severe angioedema flare. Pt initially presented to [**Location (un) 620**] for
increased lip and tongue swelling and sore throat, and received
treatment (nebulized epinephrine, benadryl, sc epinephrine, and
iv solumedrol.) Pt was then transferred to the [**Hospital1 18**] ED given
history of difficult airway. Pt was initially going to be
discharged but was eventually admitted to the ICU for further
observation. Since admission to the unit, pt has been doing
well. Pt appeared to be back to her baseline with resolution of
tongue and lip swellilng. Hoarse voice persisted, but pt denied
any difficulty breathing, and was tolerating  PO's on day of
discharge. Pt had had a sore throat since 2 days prior to
admission, with mildly productive cough, and these symptoms were
improved during her stay. A viral URI may likely have been the
trigger for her angioedema exacerbation. During admission, she
did not require any additional epinephrine or solumedrol. She
was seen by an allergist, and was discharged with 2 days total
of Prednisone 40mg daily, with a prescription for 60mg x 3 days
available for future flares.  Pt is to continue her home dose of
Prednisone 5mg every other day, and follow up with her
allergist, Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] within the next 1-2weeks. Pt was continued
on the rest of her home medications during her hospital stay.

History of Present Illness:
This is a 49 yo female who has a history of hypothyroidism,
morbid obesity, polycystic ovarian disease, but no know heart
disease presenting here with twinges in her chest and
lightheadedness.  In early [**Month (only) **] she reported to her PCP that
she was having episodic lightheadedness and palpitations.  In
particular she reported an episode of palpitation with her heart
racing and a fluttering in her neck.  She presented to her PCP
where on ECG she was noted to have a wide complex tachycardia
with RBBB morphology and left superior axis.  She was then
referred to the NWH ER where she was treated with adensine up to
12mg, metoprolol 5mg, lidocaine 25 and 50mg boluses, and
diltiazem 20 and 25mg.  She was eventually transferred to [**Hospital1 2025**] ER
where she was started on an esmolol gtt after which she
converted to sinus and remain in sinus throughout her
hospitalization at [**Hospital1 2025**].  She was discharged on metoprolol with
follow up with EP for possible EP study.
.
It was unclear if this wide complex tachycardia was SVT with
aberrency or VT.  She was seen by Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **] (see his note on
[**2126-2-8**]).  He continued metoprolol at 100mg daily.  An
adenosine MIBI didn't show any ischemia and her echo was normal.
 She was started on a holter monitor.
.
Today she presents to the ED after more intermittent episodes of
twinges in her chest and lightheadedness.  She described 2
episodes where she was sitting on her couch watching her 4 year
old daughter and 'blacked out'.  She recorded the episode on her
holter.  The cardiologist from the holter company called her at
home and told her to go immediately to the ED for evaluation for
long pauses.
.
In the ED, the patient experience another episode where she
passed out, which corresponded with a 15 second pause.  The
patient also experience two more epiosodes of 12 second pauses
with syncope. Her hemodynamics were stable with these pauses and
did not drop her blood pressure of her O2 sats's.  She was
urgently taken to the cardiology suite where a temporary pacer
was placed with a minimal rate to 60. She was transfer to the
CCU for further observation.
.
On arrival to the CCU, she was chest pain free and denies
lightheadness or SOB. She complainted of appropriate pain at the
site of the pacer insertion site on her neck.
.
On review of systems, s/he denies any prior history of stroke,
TIA, deep venous thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, bleeding at the
time of surgery, myalgias, joint pains, cough, hemoptysis, black
stools or red stools. S/he denies recent fevers, chills or
rigors. S/he denies exertional buttock or calf pain. All of the
other review of systems were negative.
.
Cardiac review of systems is notable for absence of chest pain,
dyspnea on exertion, paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, orthopnea,
ankle edema, palpitations, syncope or presyncope.

[**5-5**] Echo
The left atrium is moderately dilated. There is mild symmetric
left ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size. Left
ventricular systolic function is hyperdynamic (EF>75%). There is
valvular [**Male First Name (un) **] with a severe resting left ventricular outflow
tract obstruction (>64mmHg). Right ventricular chamber size and
free wall motion are normal. The aortic valve leaflets (?#)
appear structurally normal with good leaflet excursion. No
aortic regurgitation is seen.The mitral valve leaflets are
mildly thickened. There is systolic anterior motion of the
mitral valve leaflets. At least moderate (2+) mitral
regurgitation is seen. There is an anterior space which most
likely represents a fat pad.

IMPRESSION: Suboptimal image quality. Hypertrophic obstructive
cardiomyopathy. At least moderate mitral regurgitation.

[**5-6**] CXR
The heart size is top normal. Mediastinal position, contour and
width are
unremarkable. The pacemaker leads terminate in right atrium and
right
ventricle, unchanged in appearance since the prior study. Within
the
limitations of this study technique, no break within the leads
was
demonstrated. Lungs are essentially clear except for right
basilar opacities
that might represent an area of atelectasis, although attention
to this area
should be paid to exclude developing infection. Left basal
linear atelectasis
is new.

Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. [**Known lastname **] is a 84 year old male with a PMH of HTN, CAD, DM2
transferred from NEBH for further evaluation and management of
complete heart block treated with the placement of a dual
chamber pacemaker.

# RHYTHM:  Patient was admitted with HR in the 30s, likely a
slow junctional escape rhythm with compelete AV dissociation. As
he also had hypertension, suggesting that the rhtyhm was not
compensated. He had a dual chamber pacemaker placed on [**2158-4-17**].
Post-procedue, he had a heart rate in the 70s and patient felt
well. He tolerated pacemaker placement well. He was discharged
on metoprolol succinate 25mg daily and will follow-up in device
clinic in one week.

# CORONARIES:  Patient has a history of CAD with a distant
history of PCI. He denied any current symptoms of ischemia. He
was continued on atorvastatin, aspirin and metoprolol.

# PUMP:  He has no known history of CHF. He had an elevated BNP
and mild pulmonary edema likely secondary to his slow heart rate
and hypertension, however his lack of a supplemental oxygen
requirement was reassuring. Post pacemaker placement he was
breathing comfortably and ambulating well.

# Hypertension: His hypertension was long-standing and likely
acutely elevated on admission in the setting of bradycardia and
was allowed permissive hypertension to ensure adequate perfusion
in the setting of bradycardia.  He was continued on valsartan
and was restarted on metoprolol. In addition, amlodipine 5mg
daily was started for additional blood pressure control with
appropriate response. This should be titrated as an outpatient.

# Type 2 diabetes: Complicated by neuropathy and CRI.  His
glimiperide was held during his admission and put on humalog ISS
with fingersticks QID/ACHS. He was restarted on glimiperide on
discharge.

# Hyperlipidemmia: He was continued on his home atorvastatin.

# Neuropathic pain: He was continued on his home lidocaine
patches and neurontin.
