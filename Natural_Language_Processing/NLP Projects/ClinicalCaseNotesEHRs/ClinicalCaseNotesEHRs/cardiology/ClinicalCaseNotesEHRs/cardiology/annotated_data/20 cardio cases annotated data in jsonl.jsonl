EMS was called, who noted\nPEA and initiated CPR. He was unable to be intubated in the\nfield, so he was taken to the closest ED. There CPR was\ncontinued and after a fourth round of epinephrine, cardiac\nrhythm became VT\/VF, for which he was shocked into sinus\ntachycardia with a pulse. He was intubated, and when OG tube was\nplaced 6+ liters of bright red blood were suctioned from his\nupper GI tract. Labs there were significant for anemia and\nthrombocytopenia, acute renal failure, metabolic acidosis (pH\n6.80), elevated CK with evidence of myocardial infarction, liver\nfailure, and coagulopathy. He was resuscitated with blood\nproducts including PRBCs and FFP, in addition to IV fluids with\nlactated ringers and normal saline, as well as vasopressor\nsupport with Levophed. He developed hyperkalemia and required\ncalcium gluconate and bicarbonate. Once he was stabilized,\ntransfer to [**Hospital1 18**] MICU was arranged, and we were consulted for\npossible upper endoscopy to assess variceal hemorrhage and for\nprobable placement of [**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **] tube.\n.\nOn arrival to the floor, SBP dropped to the 60s, requiring\nadditional vasopressor support, blood products, and IV fluid\nresuscitation.\n\n\nPast Medical History:\nEtOH Abuse\nprior acute variceal hemorrhage\n\nSocial History:\nunknown\n\nFamily History:\nunknown\n\nPhysical Exam:\nADMISSION PHYSICAL EXAM\nVS: hypothermic, HR 86, NBP 69\/35, ABP 81\/48, R 14, SaO2 100%\nVent: AC - 500 x 14 \/ peep 5 \/ 100% FiO2\nGeneral: intubated\nHEENT: pupils dilated and non-responsive, sclerae anicteric,\nblood pooling in oropharynx\nLungs: CTA bilat, no r\/rh\/wh\nHeart: RRR, nl S1-S2, no murmurs\nAbdomen: decreased BS, soft\/NT\/ND, no HSM\nExtrem: no edema\nSkin: no jaundice\nNeuro: GCS 3\n\n\nPertinent Results:\nADMISSION LABS\n[**2192-8-1**] 09:46PM BLOOD WBC-6.0 RBC-2.58* Hgb-8.3* Hct-26.8*\nMCV-104* MCH-32.0 MCHC-30.8* RDW-14.7 Plt Ct-48*\n[**2192-8-1**] 09:46PM BLOOD Plt Ct-48*\n[**2192-8-1**] 09:46PM BLOOD PT-27.1* PTT-150* INR(PT)-2.6*\n[**2192-8-1**] 09:46PM BLOOD Fibrino-54*\n[**2192-8-1**] 09:46PM BLOOD Glucose-347* UreaN-37* Creat-2.9* Na-137\nK-7.6* Cl-100 HCO3-10* AnGap-35*\n[**2192-8-1**] 09:46PM BLOOD Fibrino-54*\n[**2192-8-1**] 09:46PM BLOOD ALT-435* AST-1587* LD(LDH)-2640*\nCK(CPK)-5515* AlkPhos-87 TotBili-1.7*\n[**2192-8-1**] 09:46PM BLOOD CK-MB-95* MB Indx-1.7 cTropnT-0.36*\n[**2192-8-1**] 09:46PM BLOOD Albumin-1.6* Calcium-7.5* Phos-16.9*\nMg-3.4*\n[**2192-8-1**] 10:09PM BLOOD Type-ART pO2-454* pCO2-51* pH-6.79*\ncalTCO2-9* Base XS--29\n[**2192-8-1**] 09:55PM BLOOD Lactate-18.0*\n[**2192-8-1**] 10:09PM BLOOD O2 Sat-98\n[**2192-8-1**] 10:09PM BLOOD freeCa-0.47*\n\nBrief Hospital Course:\n#) GI Bleed\/Hypovolemic Shock: Upon arriving to the MICU, the\npatient was started on a massive transfusion protocol.\nIncluding the pt's time at the OSH and on transport, the patient\nreceived a total of 15 units of pRBCs (7 here), 10 units of FFP\n(4 here), and 2 units of cryoprecipitate here.

Workup for this included a CT\nscan, which revealed a large (6cm) cavitary lesion. She\nunderwent extensive evaluation for possible metastatic disease\nincluding head MRI, PetCT and bronchoscopy, however although Pet\nrevealed markedly FDG avid\nright lower lobe mass with a satellite nodule, transbronchial\nbiopsy and washings were non diagnostic. Patient was electively\nadmitted today to have repeat rigid bronchoscopy with FNA of\nlymph nodes under ultrasound guidance. Patient was extubated\nwithout difficulty however she remained hypoxic and is still\nrequiring supplemental oxygen.\n.\nPatient denies any pain, but reports being slightly disoriented\nstill. Has a heavy cough and reports some difficulty breathing,\nno nausea.\n.\nIn the PACU, 137\/68 96 93% on 50% face tent.

No\npneumothorax seen. Patient initially did well on oxygen by\nfacemask with diuresis, but on [**3-22**] patient had increased\nrespiratory distress associated with ventricular tachycardia,\nand was intubated for hypoxic respiratory failure. Patient\ninitially received empirical levaquin for presumed CAP, but\nantimicrobials were empirically broadened to Vanco\/Cefepime on\n[**3-22**]. BAL during bronchoscopy on [**3-22**] was unremarkable. She was\nextubated the following day, but had respiratory distress again\non [**3-25**] requiring reintubation. She was transferred to the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**]\nwhere her respiratory status improved with diuresis and\nantibitiocs transiently but ultimately she could not be weaned\nfrom the Vent. Several family meetings were held during the\ncourse of her hospitalization, and with lack of progress and\ncontinued dependence on mechanical ventialtion, consistent with\nthe patients previsously expressed wishes that long term\nmechanical ventilation was not acceptable quality of life, she\nwas terminally extubated.\n.\n# Ventricular Tachycardia. Possibly triggered by\nhypoxia\/respiratory distress. 4 episodes over ~30 minutes which\nresponded to amiodarone (150 x 2 and then 0.5 mg\/min drip) and\nrespiratory support. Was intubated and started on amiodarone\ndrip with no more episodes. She did not require DC\ncardioversion. Completed amiodarone drip but continued to have\nNSVT, which resolved following repositioning of a central venous\ncatheter on [**3-26**].\n\n# RLL mass: Squamous cell on bronch biopsy. Patient was\ntransferred to the [**Hospital Ward Name **] on [**3-25**] for radiation therapy.\nRadOnc deferred therapy.\n.\n# NSTEMI\/CAD: Ruled in by troponin (peaked at 0.25) on [**3-22**] with\nflat CK. Started on heparin drip until troponin plateaud. TTE\nshowed anterior wall motion abnormalities and depressed EF with\nMR 2+. Cardiology deferred cath given her overall status.\n\n# CHF: has known diastolic CHF. Presented to [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] with florid\npulmonary edema and effusions. This was related to new, acute\nsystolic dysfunction from anterior NSTEMI compounded by 2+MR\n.\n# Hypercalcemia: Albumin only 2.2 so corrected calcium actually\n>12. With appropriately low PTH this is likely from malignancy\nrelated tumor factors. Patient received lasix and pamidronate. .\n\n\n\nMedications on Admission:\nLasix 20 mg daily\nLisinopril 20\/HCTZ 12.5 mg a day\nInderal 20 mg q.i.d.

Pt states she was in her\nusual state of health when polycythemia was noted on her labs at\nannual physical exam in [**Month (only) 547**] or [**2189-5-24**], leading to a\nworkup in which she was diagnosed with pulmonary HTN. She had\nnoted some dyspnea on exertion prior to that time but was\ngenerally active and not bothered by her symptoms, which she\nassociated with her past smoking history. PFTs showed moderate\nobstructive airway disease with severely reduced DLCO; CT showed\napical bullous emphysema as well as basilar pulmonary fibrosis.\nIn [**8-\/2189**], she reports starting home O2 that she has required\nconstantly since then. She reports starting Spiriva and\nSymbicort around that time. Her condition worsened subacutely in\n[**12\/2189**], when she was found to have low blood pressure at an\noutpatient visit and admitted to the hospital for a week.\nShe was readmitted about 3 weeks ago with 3-4 days of worsening\ndyspnea and some lethargy. On admission, she had a WBC of 15 on\nprednisone and was on 3L O2 with a sat of 76%. Her sat improved\non CPAP, although it was difficult for her to tolerate. She was\ntreated for a possible PNA with antibiotics\nlevofloxacin\/vancomycin (completed 14 day course) and also\nreceived solumedrol. Her sats have usually been 91-93% on a 50%\nventi mask, although she desats with anxiety. She was treated\nwith an insulin sliding scale for new hyperglycemia in the\nsetting of steroids. She received diltiazem during the admission\nbut it was held [**2-23**] for SBP 80s which responded to a 500 cc\nbolus. Pt had an episode of urinary retention, with placement of\na foley 3 days ago.\nPt reports sore throat, nasal congestion, and cough productive\nof sputum that was initially dark brown (weeks ago) and is now\nyellowish. She denies pleuritic chest pain, fevers\/chills, and\npalpitations although she notes occasional panic attacks.\n+constipation.\n\nPast Medical History:\nhyperglycemia--first noted on current admission in the setting\nof steroids, pt has been on insulin sliding scale as inpt\nPulmonary HTN as above, R sided heart failure.\n\nSocial History:\n Lives with daughter in [**Name (NI) 1411**], used to work in home decor until\neconomy crashed.

She had increasing O2\nrequirements and complained of worsening dyspnea throughout her\nstay.  She was uncomfortable lying flat, and did not undergo\nright-heart catheterization.  She eventually required 100% NRB,\nand then non-invasive ventilation with PEEP and 100% FiO2 in\norder to maintain oxygenation.  Her labs and ABGs suggested\nrespiratory fatigue and systemic ischemia (rising lactate;\nantibiotics were started in case this represented sepsis).  A\nfamily meeting was held with the patient and her family; she had\na significant risk of mortality from CPR and intubation, and\nmight possibly never be able to be weaned from a ventilator in\nthe setting of her bad emphysema, pulmonary fibrosis, and\npulmonary hypertension.  Patient and family decided to decline\nintubation and her management was shifted towards\ncomfort-focused care.

TTE and CT chest showed\ndilated RV and RA, a large secundum ASD (2.1 cm. Cath showed no\nangiographically CAD, his right sided pressures were normal with\nQp\/Qs of 2.4, therefore he was considered a good candicate for\nASD closure.  Patient had closure of ASD with amplatzer device\nwithout any complcaitions however closure device was difficult\nto seat in the septal defect therefore he was admitted for\nmonitoring in the CCU.  During his short CCU stay patient did\nnot have any chest pain, shortness of breath or any other\nsymptoms.  His cath site remained clean and dry without any\nbleeding. He did however have occasional central apnea during\nsleep right after being extubated which resolved after few\nhours. Follow up TTE showed the amplazter device in place\nwithout any shunting.  During this hospitalization he was\nstarted on aspirin x1 year and plavix x 3 months.

There is severe regional left ventricular systolic\ndysfunction with akinesis of the mid and distal segments of the\ninferior, inferolateral and lateral walls, as well as anterior\nwall, septum and apex (basal segments of the anterior septum,\ninferolateral wall and anterior wall are best preserved).\nOverall LVEF = 15-20%. There is no ventricular septal defect.\nRight ventricular chamber size is normal with moderate global\nfree wall hypokinesis. No aortic regurgitation is seen. The\nmitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Mild (1+) mitral\nregurgitation is seen. There is at least mild pulmonary artery\nsystolic hypertension (may be underestimated, given uncertainty\nabout right atrial pressure). There is no pericardial effusion.\n\nIMPRESSION: Severe regional left ventricular systolic\ndysfunction, c\/w multivessel CAD. Moderate right ventricular\nsystolic dysfunction. At least mild pulmonary hypertension.\n\nBrief Hospital Course:\n50 yo male with h\/o HCV presented with NSTEMI.\n\nNSTEMI:  Patient initially went to the cath lab where he was\nfound to have LAD chronically occluded (mid) and LCX mid segment\nwith thrombus (assumed culprit lesion).  Balloon angioplasty was\nattempted secondary to low platelets (didn't want to give stent\nrequiring antiplatelet therapy) but with suboptimal results;\nultimately a bare metal stent was placed.  RCA was patent but\ncould not be fully engaged; origin may be anomalous.  He\nreceived heparin during procedure (started at OSH).  LVEDP was\nelevated, but this was attributed to large dye load while trying\nto visualize RCA.  Bivalirudin gtt was started after the\nprocedure.  ASA and plavix were continued\n.\nAfter the catheterization, patient was admitted to [**Hospital Unit Name 196**]. About\n30-60 minutes after arrival on the floor, he complained of\nrecurrent chest pain, nausea, back pain. SBP was initially in\nthe 100s on arrival on the floor but then dropped to the 80s\nthen 70s. Patient was given IVF bolus. He then vomitted, became\nunconscious, and went into PEA arrest. CPR was started. He was\ngiven epinephrine 1 mg. Pulses returned. Patient regained\nconsciousness, again vomited coffee-ground emesis. He was\nintubated. Started on dopamine and wide-open IVF. Transferred to\nCCU. ECG showed new ST depression in precordial leads and ST\nelevations in II, III. R-sided ECG showed ST elevations in\nlateral leads.  He was taken back to the cath lab where stent\nwas found to be patent.\n.\nIn the ccu, the patient continued to be in tachycarda to the\n120s and 130s and hypotensive, with falling urine output despite\npRBC and multiple fluid boluses.  There was concern for\nretroperitoneal hemorrhage post-catheterization, and CT abdomen\nwithout contrast was done which did not show evidence of such. A\npulmonary artery catheter was placed for monitorring.  Shortly\nafter placement, patient was bradycardic to the 40s, thought to\nbe secondary to vagal stimulation from the catheter.  He\nreceived atropine with return of sinus tachycardia briefly,\nfollowed by junctional bradycardia.  His blood pressure then\nfell to the 40s.  CPR was initiated, and epinephrine given.  He\nwas also treated for hyperkalemia with insulin, glucose, and\ncalcium.  Echo showed no evidence of effusion or tamponade.\nBradycardia and hypotension worsened and the patient became\nasystolic.  The patient expired.\n.\n# PUMP: No known h\/o diastolic\/systolic function, had elevated\nLVEDP in Cath lab. Echo showed hypokinesis and LVEF 15-20% with\nsevere regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction and\nakinesis of the mid and distal segments of the inferior,\ninferolateral and lateral walls, as well as anterior wall,\nseptum and apex.\n.\n# [**Name (NI) 1867**] Pt with plts 57. His hepatologist was\ncontact[**Name (NI) **] who stated that thrombocytopenia was secondary to\nrecent interferon therapy and was at recent baseline.\n.\n# HCV and GI bleed: Patient had a history of HCV. LFTs mildly\nelevated, T.bili WNL; pt has completed IFN\/ribavarin and per\nreport recent viral load undetectable. Per hepatologist, patient\ndid not have a history of known varices.  However, given his\ncoffee ground emesis and subsequent dark brown fluid from\ngastric suction, GI was consulted.\n\n\nMedications on Admission:\nMucinex dose unknown\nlexapro 20mg

Obliquity of the patient makes it\ndifficult to\nevaluate mediastinal structures. However, the single frontal\nview shows no\ndefinite tracheal abnormality. Cardiac silhouette is somewhat\nprominent and\nthere is indistinctness of pulmonary vessels suggesting some\nelevated\npulmonary venous pressure.

Pt initially presented to [**Location (un) 620**] for\nincreased lip and tongue swelling and sore throat, and received\ntreatment (nebulized epinephrine, benadryl, sc epinephrine, and\niv solumedrol.) Pt was then transferred to the [**Hospital1 18**] ED given\nhistory of difficult airway. Pt was initially going to be\ndischarged but was eventually admitted to the ICU for further\nobservation. Since admission to the unit, pt has been doing\nwell. Pt appeared to be back to her baseline with resolution of\ntongue and lip swellilng. Hoarse voice persisted, but pt denied\nany difficulty breathing, and was tolerating  PO's on day of\ndischarge. Pt had had a sore throat since 2 days prior to\nadmission, with mildly productive cough, and these symptoms were\nimproved during her stay. A viral URI may likely have been the\ntrigger for her angioedema exacerbation. During admission, she\ndid not require any additional epinephrine or solumedrol. She\nwas seen by an allergist, and was discharged with 2 days total\nof Prednisone 40mg daily, with a prescription for 60mg x 3 days\navailable for future flares.
