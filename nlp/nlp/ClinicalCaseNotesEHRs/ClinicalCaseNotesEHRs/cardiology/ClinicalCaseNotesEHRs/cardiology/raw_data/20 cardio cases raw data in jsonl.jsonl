EMS was called, who noted\nPEA and initiated CPR. He was unable to be intubated in the\nfield, so he was taken to the closest ED. There CPR was\ncontinued and after a fourth round of epinephrine, cardiac\nrhythm became VT/VF, for which he was shocked into sinus\ntachycardia with a pulse. He was intubated, and when OG tube was\nplaced 6+ liters of bright red blood were suctioned from his\nupper GI tract. Labs there were significant for anemia and\nthrombocytopenia, acute renal failure, metabolic acidosis (pH\n6.80), elevated CK with evidence of myocardial infarction, liver\nfailure, and coagulopathy. He was resuscitated with blood\nproducts including PRBCs and FFP, in addition to IV fluids with\nlactated ringers and normal saline, as well as vasopressor\nsupport with Levophed. He developed hyperkalemia and required\ncalcium gluconate and bicarbonate. Once he was stabilized,\ntransfer to [**Hospital1 18**] MICU was arranged, and we were consulted for\npossible upper endoscopy to assess variceal hemorrhage and for\nprobable placement of [**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **] tube.\n.\nOn arrival to the floor, SBP dropped to the 60s, requiring\nadditional vasopressor support, blood products, and IV fluid\nresuscitation.\n\n\nPast Medical History:\nEtOH Abuse\nprior acute variceal hemorrhage\n\nSocial History:\nunknown\n\nFamily History:\nunknown\n\nPhysical Exam:\nADMISSION PHYSICAL EXAM\nVS: hypothermic, HR 86, NBP 69/35, ABP 81/48, R 14, SaO2 100%\nVent: AC - 500 x 14 / peep 5 / 100% FiO2\nGeneral: intubated\nHEENT: pupils dilated and non-responsive, sclerae anicteric,\nblood pooling in oropharynx\nLungs: CTA bilat, no r/rh/wh\nHeart: RRR, nl S1-S2, no murmurs\nAbdomen: decreased BS, soft/NT/ND, no HSM\nExtrem: no edema\nSkin: no jaundice\nNeuro: GCS 3\n\n\nPertinent Results:\nADMISSION LABS\n[**2192-8-1**] 09:46PM BLOOD WBC-6.0 RBC-2.58* Hgb-8.3* Hct-26.8*\nMCV-104* MCH-32.0 MCHC-30.8* RDW-14.7 Plt Ct-48*\n[**2192-8-1**] 09:46PM BLOOD Plt Ct-48*\n[**2192-8-1**] 09:46PM BLOOD PT-27.1* PTT-150* INR(PT)-2.6*\n[**2192-8-1**] 09:46PM BLOOD Fibrino-54*\n[**2192-8-1**] 09:46PM BLOOD Glucose-347* UreaN-37* Creat-2.9* Na-137\nK-7.6* Cl-100 HCO3-10* AnGap-35*\n[**2192-8-1**] 09:46PM BLOOD Fibrino-54*\n[**2192-8-1**] 09:46PM BLOOD ALT-435* AST-1587* LD(LDH)-2640*\nCK(CPK)-5515* AlkPhos-87 TotBili-1.7*\n[**2192-8-1**] 09:46PM BLOOD CK-MB-95* MB Indx-1.7 cTropnT-0.36*\n[**2192-8-1**] 09:46PM BLOOD Albumin-1.6* Calcium-7.5* Phos-16.9*\nMg-3.4*\n[**2192-8-1**] 10:09PM BLOOD Type-ART pO2-454* pCO2-51* pH-6.79*\ncalTCO2-9* Base XS--29\n[**2192-8-1**] 09:55PM BLOOD Lactate-18.0*\n[**2192-8-1**] 10:09PM BLOOD O2 Sat-98\n[**2192-8-1**] 10:09PM BLOOD freeCa-0.47*\n\nBrief Hospital Course:\n#) GI Bleed/Hypovolemic Shock: Upon arriving to the MICU, the\npatient was started on a massive transfusion protocol.\nIncluding the pt's time at the OSH and on transport, the patient\nreceived a total of 15 units of pRBCs (7 here), 10 units of FFP\n(4 here), and 2 units of cryoprecipitate here.

No\npneumothorax seen. Patient initially did well on oxygen by\nfacemask with diuresis, but on [**3-22**] patient had increased\nrespiratory distress associated with ventricular tachycardia,\nand was intubated for hypoxic respiratory failure. Patient\ninitially received empirical levaquin for presumed CAP, but\nantimicrobials were empirically broadened to Vanco/Cefepime on\n[**3-22**]. BAL during bronchoscopy on [**3-22**] was unremarkable. She was\nextubated the following day, but had respiratory distress again\non [**3-25**] requiring reintubation. She was transferred to the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**]\nwhere her respiratory status improved with diuresis and\nantibitiocs transiently but ultimately she could not be weaned\nfrom the Vent. Several family meetings were held during the\ncourse of her hospitalization, and with lack of progress and\ncontinued dependence on mechanical ventialtion, consistent with\nthe patients previsously expressed wishes that long term\nmechanical ventilation was not acceptable quality of life, she\nwas terminally extubated.\n.\n# Ventricular Tachycardia. Possibly triggered by\nhypoxia/respiratory distress. 4 episodes over ~30 minutes which\nresponded to amiodarone (150 x 2 and then 0.5 mg/min drip) and\nrespiratory support. Was intubated and started on amiodarone\ndrip with no more episodes. She did not require DC\ncardioversion. Completed amiodarone drip but continued to have\nNSVT, which resolved following repositioning of a central venous\ncatheter on [**3-26**].\n\n# RLL mass: Squamous cell on bronch biopsy. Patient was\ntransferred to the [**Hospital Ward Name **] on [**3-25**] for radiation therapy.\nRadOnc deferred therapy.\n.\n# NSTEMI/CAD: Ruled in by troponin (peaked at 0.25) on [**3-22**] with\nflat CK. Started on heparin drip until troponin plateaud. TTE\nshowed anterior wall motion abnormalities and depressed EF with\nMR 2+. Cardiology deferred cath given her overall status.\n\n# CHF: has known diastolic CHF. Presented to [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] with florid\npulmonary edema and effusions. This was related to new, acute\nsystolic dysfunction from anterior NSTEMI compounded by 2+MR\n.\n# Hypercalcemia: Albumin only 2.2 so corrected calcium actually\n>12.

At least mild pulmonary hypertension.\n\nBrief Hospital Course:\n50 yo male with h/o HCV presented with NSTEMI.\n\nNSTEMI:  Patient initially went to the cath lab where he was\nfound to have LAD chronically occluded (mid) and LCX mid segment\nwith thrombus (assumed culprit lesion).  Balloon angioplasty was\nattempted secondary to low platelets (didn't want to give stent\nrequiring antiplatelet therapy) but with suboptimal results;\nultimately a bare metal stent was placed.  RCA was patent but\ncould not be fully engaged; origin may be anomalous.  He\nreceived heparin during procedure (started at OSH).  LVEDP was\nelevated, but this was attributed to large dye load while trying\nto visualize RCA.  Bivalirudin gtt was started after the\nprocedure.  ASA and plavix were continued\n.\nAfter the catheterization, patient was admitted to [**Hospital Unit Name 196**]. About\n30-60 minutes after arrival on the floor, he complained of\nrecurrent chest pain, nausea, back pain. SBP was initially in\nthe 100s on arrival on the floor but then dropped to the 80s\nthen 70s. Patient was given IVF bolus. He then vomitted, became\nunconscious, and went into PEA arrest. CPR was started. He was\ngiven epinephrine 1 mg. Pulses returned. Patient regained\nconsciousness, again vomited coffee-ground emesis. He was\nintubated. Started on dopamine and wide-open IVF. Transferred to\nCCU. ECG showed new ST depression in precordial leads and ST\nelevations in II, III. R-sided ECG showed ST elevations in\nlateral leads.  He was taken back to the cath lab where stent\nwas found to be patent.\n.\nIn the ccu, the patient continued to be in tachycarda to the\n120s and 130s and hypotensive, with falling urine output despite\npRBC and multiple fluid boluses.  There was concern for\nretroperitoneal hemorrhage post-catheterization, and CT abdomen\nwithout contrast was done which did not show evidence of such. A\npulmonary artery catheter was placed for monitorring.  Shortly\nafter placement, patient was bradycardic to the 40s, thought to\nbe secondary to vagal stimulation from the catheter.  He\nreceived atropine with return of sinus tachycardia briefly,\nfollowed by junctional bradycardia.  His blood pressure then\nfell to the 40s.  CPR was initiated, and epinephrine given.  He\nwas also treated for hyperkalemia with insulin, glucose, and\ncalcium.  Echo showed no evidence of effusion or tamponade.\nBradycardia and hypotension worsened and the patient became\nasystolic.  The patient expired.\n.\n# PUMP: No known h/o diastolic/systolic function, had elevated\nLVEDP in Cath lab. Echo showed hypokinesis and LVEF 15-20% with\nsevere regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction and\nakinesis of the mid and distal segments of the inferior,\ninferolateral and lateral walls, as well as anterior wall,\nseptum and apex.\n.\n# [**Name (NI) 1867**] Pt with plts 57.
