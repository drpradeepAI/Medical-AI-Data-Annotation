Allergies:
Boniva

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 425**]
Chief Complaint:
chest pain

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Cardiac catheterization with angioplasty


History of Present Illness:
[**Age over 90 **]F history of hypertension, hyperlipidemia, recent
hospitalization for NSTEMI with acute systolic CHF that is
transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for c. cath.
Patient was recently admitted from [**2141-4-7**] to [**2141-4-11**] at
[**Hospital1 **] for acute on chronic systolic congestive heart
failure, acute coronary syndrome s/p NSTEMI with intermittent
short runs of atrial fibrillation.
[**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Location (un) 620**] discharge summaries, the patient was complaining of
mid-upper back pain for 6 months on admission most recently
complicated by shortness of breath and diaphoresis. She was
found to have acute pulmonary edema as well as acute coronary
syndrome. She was admitted to the ICU for further treatment.
In the ICU, she was treated for acute on chronic decompensated
systolic congestive heart failure with pulmonary edema. She was
diuresed with lasix approximately 4 L net negative. Her pOx was
90 % on 2 L NC, and weaning of O2 failed. She would drop to pOx
87 % at rest. She was continued on lasix in addition to
spironolactone on discharge.
Patient also experienced NSTEMI with maximum troponin of 0.176.
She was started on a heparin infusion. The family decided
against intervention and favored medical management at the time.

She was also noted to have anemia with a Hct drop by 9 points
with discontinuation of heparin. She was also treated with a
nitroglycerin infusion to treat recurrent chest pain. Stool
guiaics were negative. She was given one unit of pRBC with
discharge Hct of 36.7.
She was placed on aspirin, plavix, and a statin. She was also
discharged on lisionpril as well and a small dose of
beta-blocker.
The patient was evaluated by Cardiology, Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] on
[**2141-4-10**] for
intermittent and atrial fibrillation. No need for treatment was

recommended. Heart rate is well controlled. The patient will
follow up as an outpatient with both primary care physician and
Cardiology.
Echocardiogram showed hypokinesis in the mid anterolateral wall,
the distal lateral wall and the apex. Ejection fraction was
approximately 45%.
The patient weight on discharge was 112 pounds ([**2141-4-11**]), which
seems to be her baseline.
Patient was brought in by ambulance to [**Location (un) 620**] today for chest
pain. Initial VS were 97.0 HR: 90 BP: 145/85 Resp: 17 O(2)Sat:
94 Low. She reported intermittent chest pain for the last week
and was discharged from [**Location (un) 620**] as above. Yesterday, her pain
returned with 3-4 episodes of chest pain occuring at rest. This
morning while she was walking back from the bathroom very
slowly, the pain returned and it had been persistent since that
time. Initial troponin was 0.046.
Impression was that patient was presenting with her typical
anginal symptoms but that they were not occurring at rest and
with minimal exertion. ECG (not available for review, per
reports ST-depressions primarily in V3-V6 that resolved. )
showed ST depressions while having pain (distribution unknown).
She was given aspirin, NTG, heparin. It was discussed that
intervention was advisable, and patient was transferred to
[**Hospital1 18**].
Initial VS on arrival were HR 67 RR 14 BP 127/62 pOx 94 on 3 L.
Pain was 0/10. She arrived on heparin insuion at 700 units and
nitroglycerin infusion at 20 mcgs down to 14 mcgs at admission.
Per reports, there were new ST depressions in I, aVL, and V3-V6.
Patient was pain free. CXR was performed showing moderate
pulmonary edema.
She was taken to the c. cath lab on arrival.
C. cath with left radial approach showed 99 % distal left main
into the proximal LAD. LAD was 99 % at origin followed by
proximal 60 % involving D1. LCx had ostial occlusion.
Collaterals fill a diseased OM1 and OM2 from RCA. RCA had mild
luminal irregularties. Left subclavian was 70-80 % at origin.
BMS x 2 was performed to left main/proximal LAD.
During the procedure, she had transient hypotension while
catheter was in the RCA, which could have represented ?
dampening on the catheter while in RCA - which resolved within
30 seconds. She also had bradycardia while in RCA, which
resolved within 30 seconds. It was favored that this was
probably catheter induced.
After procedure, patient had a small amount of chest pain that
was improved from pre-procedure chest pain. She was sent to the
CCU with nitroglycerin infusion. She was given ASA 325 mg PO x 1
and plavix 75 mg PO x 1. Heparin infusion was discontinued at 1
PM.
On arrival to CCU, CCU team met with patient and family. Per
family, patient not complaining of any chest discomfort but does
feel slightly "faint."
.
On review of systems, patient unable to provide comprehensive
review of systems. She denies any chest pain.
.
Cardiac review of systems is notable for absence of chest pain,
dyspnea on exertion, paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, orthopnea,
ankle edema, palpitations, syncope or presyncope.

Pertinent Results:
[**2141-4-17**] ECHO
The left atrium is elongated. No atrial septal defect is seen by
2D or color Doppler. Left ventricular wall thicknesses and
cavity size are normal. There is mild regional left ventricular
systolic dysfunction with severe hypokinesis of the basal half
of the inferolateral wall and mild dyskinesis of the distal
inferior wall. The remaining segments contract normally (LVEF =
45-50 %). Tissue Doppler imaging suggests an increased left
ventricular filling pressure (PCWP>18mmHg). Right ventricular
chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The aortic valve
leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with good leaflet
excursion and no aortic stenosis. Trace aortic regurgitation is
seen. The mitral valve leaflets are structurally normal. There
is no mitral valve prolapse. Mild to moderate ([**1-16**]+) mitral
regurgitation is seen. There is mild pulmonary artery systolic
hypertension. There is no pericardial effusion.
IMPRESSION: Normal left ventricular cavity size with mild
regional systolic dysfunction c/w CAD (PDA distribution).
Mild-moderate mitral regurgitation. Pulmonary artery
hypertension. Increased PCWP.

[**2141-4-14**] CARDIAC CATH
Patient brought urgently to the cath lab given rest angina in
the
holding area despite maximal medical therapy.  She had chest
pain
ongoing at the time of arrival to the catheterization
laboratory.
Subclavian angiography performed during entry due to difficulty
advancing the guide wire to the ascending aorta.  This revealed
an origin 70-80% stenosis.  An angled glide wire was advanced
past the blockage and into the ascending aorta easily.  A 6
French JL3.5 guide provided good support.  A ChoICE PT XS wire
was advanced into the diagonal and the lesion was predilated
with
a 2.0 balloon which improved chest pain symptoms.  The ChoICE PT
XS [**Name (NI) **] was redirected into the distal LAD.  A 3.5 x 12 mm
Integriti stent was deployed and a more distal overlapping 2.5 x
18 mm Integriti stent.  The Proximal portion of the distal stent
and the 3.5 mm stent were postdilated with a 3.5 mm balloon.
The
distal portion of the proximal stent was postdilated with a 4.0
mm balloon.  Final angiography revealed normal flow, no
dissection and 0% residual stenosis in the stent.  The patient
tolerated the procedure well and left the laboratory in stable
condition with almost complete relief of her chest pain.

Brief Hospital Course:
[**Age over 90 **] female with h/o HTN, HLD, recent NSTEMI, and sCHF (45-50%)
presented to [**Hospital1 **] [**Location (un) 620**] with UA, transferred for c. cath
showing significant left main and LAD disease s/p BMSx2 with
transient hypotension/bradycardia during procedure attributed to
catheter placement.
.
# CAD
Patient had NSTEMI that was medically managed a week prior to
admission.  She presented again with chest pain consistent with
unstable angina, associated with ECG changes and borderline
cardiac biomarkers.  She was started on heparin and
nitroglycerin infusion and transferred to [**Hospital1 18**].  After
discussions with her family, a cardiac catheterization was
performed revealing significant left main and LAD disease.  Two
BMS were placed in the left circumflex ostial occlusion with
collaterals.  The patient had transient hypotension/bradycardiac
during her procedure attributed to catheter placement.  She was
monitored in the CCU after and her vital signs remained stable.
She is to continue ASA 325 mg indefinitely and will require
plavix 75 mg daily for at least 1 month, but preferably for 12
months.  She was continued on metoprolol with a goal heart rate
of 60-70.  She was also continued on lisinopril and started on
atorvastatin for optimal medical management.  She remained chest
pain free during her stay.
.
# Acute on chronic systolic heart failure (Most recent EF
45-50%)
Pt was recently discharged from [**Hospital1 **]-Neeham with a documented
weight of 112 lbs (50.9 kg).  She had recently been started on
lasix, lisinopril and spironolactone.  She did not appear
overtly fluid overloaded on admission, and her admission weight
was 107.8 lbs (49 kgs).  Her admission CXR revealed some
evidence of mild-moderate pulmonary edema, which may reflect
diastolic dysfunction from demand ischemia.  Her I/O were
monitoered and she was weighed daily.  Lasix and spironoloactone
were held.  A repeat TTE revealed Normal left ventricular cavity
size with mild regional systolic dysfunction c/w CAD (PDA
distribution).
.
# RHYTHM:
The patient has known paroxysmal AF, but was in NSR upon
admission. The morning of [**4-16**], she was noted to be in atrial
fibrillation with rapid ventricular response.  She was
hemodynamically stable.  She was given metoprolol 5 mg IV x2
with out a significant drop in her heart rate.  She was then
loaded with amiodarone (initially IV, later transitioned to po
when she converted back to sinus).  She remained in NSR
throughout the rest of her hospital course and is to continue on
amiodarone upon discharge.
.
# Hyponatremia
The patient's admission Na was 127, and initially thought to be
secondary to intravascular volume depletion with non-osmotic
release of ADH given active usage of diuretic regimen.
Her sodium continued to trend down.  Urine electrolytes were
consistent with diuresis leading to hyponatremia.
Her fluids were restricted and she was given small boluses of
IVF given likely hypovolemia.  Her sodium stabilized to 125.
.
# HTN
The patient was continued on her home metoprolol and lisinopril.
 As above, her furosemide and spironolactone here held.  She
remained normotensive throughout her CCU and floor stay.
.
# HLD
Her most recent lipid panel ([**2141-4-8**]) revealed good lipid
control (chol 134, TG 57, HDL 71, LDL 43).  She was continued on
atorvastatin 80 mg given her ACS.
.
# Left subclavian stenosis
Her BP was monitored on her right arm.  This should be monitored
as an outpatient.
.
# History of fasting glucose intolerance
Her most recent HbA1c was 6.2 on [**2141-4-7**].  Her morning glucose
ranged from 100-140s on average.

Facility:
[**Company 1519**]

Discharge Diagnosis:
Myocardial infarction
Hyponatremia

Discharge Condition:
Mental Status: Clear and coherent.
Level of Consciousness: Alert and interactive.
Activity Status: Ambulatory - Independent.

Discharge Instructions:
You were admitted for a heart attack. You had a procedure called
a cardiac catheterization to place a stent to open up some of
the clogged arteries which supply blood to the heart.  Because
of this procedure, it will be extremely important to follow-up
with your primary doctor and to establish care with a
cardiologist.  You should also continue to take your medications
exactly as prescribed to prevent complications.
.
You were also found to have a low sodium level, which was
probably due to being dehydrated.  Because of this, you should
STOP taking your water pills (diuretics, called lasix).  It will
be very important to have labs checked with your primary doctor,
and to discuss whether to re-start your water pills at your
follow-up appointment
.
Please note the following medication changes:
-STOP taking lasix and spironolactone (the water pills) until
you speak with your primary doctor at your follow-up appointment
.
-STOP taking metoprolol TARTRATE and
-START taking metoprolol SUCCINATE
.
-START taking plavix
-START taking Aspirin 325mg daily
-START taking atorvastatin 80mg daily
-START taking amiodarone 200mg twice daily with meals for 1
month. After one month, decrease amiodarone to 200mg ONCE daily
with meals.
.
-STOP taking zocor
-DECREASE lisinopril to 5mg daily until you follow-up with your
primary doctor at the end of the week
