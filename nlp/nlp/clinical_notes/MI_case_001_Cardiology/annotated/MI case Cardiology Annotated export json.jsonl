She was\nfound to have acute pulmonary edema as well as acute coronary\nsyndrome. She was admitted to the ICU for further treatment.\nIn the ICU, she was treated for acute on chronic decompensated\nsystolic congestive heart failure with pulmonary edema. She was\ndiuresed with lasix approximately 4 L net negative. Her pOx was\n90 % on 2 L NC, and weaning of O2 failed. She would drop to pOx\n87 % at rest. She was continued on lasix in addition to\nspironolactone on discharge.\nPatient also experienced NSTEMI with maximum troponin of 0.176.\nShe was started on a heparin infusion. The family decided\nagainst intervention and favored medical management at the time.\n\nShe was also noted to have anemia with a Hct drop by 9 points\nwith discontinuation of heparin. She was also treated with a\nnitroglycerin infusion to treat recurrent chest pain. Stool\nguiaics were negative. She was given one unit of pRBC with\ndischarge Hct of 36.7.\nShe was placed on aspirin, plavix, and a statin. She was also\ndischarged on lisionpril as well and a small dose of\nbeta-blocker.\nThe patient was evaluated by Cardiology, Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] on\n[**2141-4-10**] for\nintermittent and atrial fibrillation. No need for treatment was\n\nrecommended. Heart rate is well controlled. The patient will\nfollow up as an outpatient with both primary care physician and\nCardiology.\nEchocardiogram showed hypokinesis in the mid anterolateral wall,\nthe distal lateral wall and the apex. Ejection fraction was\napproximately 45%.\nThe patient weight on discharge was 112 pounds ([**2141-4-11**]), which\nseems to be her baseline.\nPatient was brought in by ambulance to [**Location (un) 620**] today for chest\npain. Initial VS were 97.0 HR: 90 BP: 145\/85 Resp: 17 O(2)Sat:\n94 Low. She reported intermittent chest pain for the last week\nand was discharged from [**Location (un) 620**] as above. Yesterday, her pain\nreturned with 3-4 episodes of chest pain occuring at rest. This\nmorning while she was walking back from the bathroom very\nslowly, the pain returned and it had been persistent since that\ntime. Initial troponin was 0.046.\nImpression was that patient was presenting with her typical\nanginal symptoms but that they were not occurring at rest and\nwith minimal exertion. ECG (not available for review, per\nreports ST-depressions primarily in V3-V6 that resolved. )\nshowed ST depressions while having pain (distribution unknown).\nShe was given aspirin, NTG, heparin. It was discussed that\nintervention was advisable, and patient was transferred to\n[**Hospital1 18**].\nInitial VS on arrival were HR 67 RR 14 BP 127\/62 pOx 94 on 3 L.\nPain was 0\/10. She arrived on heparin insuion at 700 units and\nnitroglycerin infusion at 20 mcgs down to 14 mcgs at admission.\nPer reports, there were new ST depressions in I, aVL, and V3-V6.\nPatient was pain free. CXR was performed showing moderate\npulmonary edema.\nShe was taken to the c. cath lab on arrival.\nC. cath with left radial approach showed 99 % distal left main\ninto the proximal LAD. LAD was 99 % at origin followed by\nproximal 60 % involving D1. LCx had ostial occlusion.\nCollaterals fill a diseased OM1 and OM2 from RCA. RCA had mild\nluminal irregularties. Left subclavian was 70-80 % at origin.\nBMS x 2 was performed to left main\/proximal LAD.\nDuring the procedure, she had transient hypotension while\ncatheter was in the RCA, which could have represented ?\ndampening on the catheter while in RCA - which resolved within\n30 seconds. She also had bradycardia while in RCA, which\nresolved within 30 seconds. It was favored that this was\nprobably catheter induced.\nAfter procedure, patient had a small amount of chest pain that\nwas improved from pre-procedure chest pain. She was sent to the\nCCU with nitroglycerin infusion. She was given ASA 325 mg PO x 1\nand plavix 75 mg PO x 1. Heparin infusion was discontinued at 1\nPM.\nOn arrival to CCU, CCU team met with patient and family. Per\nfamily, patient not complaining of any chest discomfort but does\nfeel slightly \"faint.\"\n.\nOn review of systems, patient unable to provide comprehensive\nreview of systems. She denies any chest pain.\n.\nCardiac review of systems is notable for absence of chest pain,\ndyspnea on exertion, paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, orthopnea,\nankle edema, palpitations, syncope or presyncope.\n\n\nPast Medical History:\n- Acute-on-chronic systolic congestive heart failure.\n- Recent Acute coronary syndrome, status post non-ST elevation\nmyocardial infarction.\n- History of paroxysmal atrial fibrillation.\n- Anemia.\n- Poor functional status.\n- Hypertension\n- Arthritis\n- Hypothyroidism\n- Hyperlipidemia\n- Fasting glucose intolerance based on A1c 6.2 on [**2141-4-7**]\n\nPAST SURGICAL HISTORY:\n- Hysterectomy\n\nSocial History:\nShe denies tobacco, alcohol, or illicit drug usage.\n\n\nFamily History:\nMother: Unknown history\nFather: Unknown history\nSiblings: She has one sister who died at age [**Age over 90 **]\nChildren: Three children, two sons and one daughter.  [**Name (NI) **]\ndaughter developed arthritis in her mid 50s\n\n\nPhysical Exam:\nGeneral: No acute distress,\nHEENT: PERRL, MMM, OP clear, sclera anicteric\nCardio: RRR, nl s1s2, no m\/r\/g\nResp: Clear b\/l.\nAbdominal: soft, non-tender\nExtremities: WWP, no edema\n\nPertinent Results:\n[**2141-4-17**] ECHO\nThe left atrium is elongated. No atrial septal defect is seen by\n2D or color Doppler. Left ventricular wall thicknesses and\ncavity size are normal. There is mild regional left ventricular\nsystolic dysfunction with severe hypokinesis of the basal half\nof the inferolateral wall and mild dyskinesis of the distal\ninferior wall. The remaining segments contract normally (LVEF =\n45-50 %). Tissue Doppler imaging suggests an increased left\nventricular filling pressure (PCWP>18mmHg). Right ventricular\nchamber size and free wall motion are normal. The aortic valve\nleaflets (3) appear structurally normal with good leaflet\nexcursion and no aortic stenosis. Trace aortic regurgitation is\nseen. The mitral valve leaflets are structurally normal. There\nis no mitral valve prolapse. Mild to moderate ([**1-16**]+) mitral\nregurgitation is seen. There is mild pulmonary artery systolic\nhypertension. There is no pericardial effusion.\nIMPRESSION: Normal left ventricular cavity size with mild\nregional systolic dysfunction c\/w CAD (PDA distribution).\nMild-moderate mitral regurgitation. Pulmonary artery\nhypertension. Increased PCWP.\n\n[**2141-4-14**] CARDIAC CATH\nPatient brought urgently to the cath lab given rest angina in\nthe\nholding area despite maximal medical therapy.  She had chest\npain\nongoing at the time of arrival to the catheterization\nlaboratory.\nSubclavian angiography performed during entry due to difficulty\nadvancing the guide wire to the ascending aorta.  This revealed\nan origin 70-80% stenosis.  An angled glide wire was advanced\npast the blockage and into the ascending aorta easily.  A 6\nFrench JL3.5 guide provided good support.  A ChoICE PT XS wire\nwas advanced into the diagonal and the lesion was predilated\nwith\na 2.0 balloon which improved chest pain symptoms.  The ChoICE PT\nXS [**Name (NI) **] was redirected into the distal LAD.  A 3.5 x 12 mm\nIntegriti stent was deployed and a more distal overlapping 2.5 x\n18 mm Integriti stent.  The Proximal portion of the distal stent\nand the 3.5 mm stent were postdilated with a 3.5 mm balloon.\nThe\ndistal portion of the proximal stent was postdilated with a 4.0\nmm balloon.  Final angiography revealed normal flow, no\ndissection and 0% residual stenosis in the stent.  The patient\ntolerated the procedure well and left the laboratory in stable\ncondition with almost complete relief of her chest pain.\n\n[**2141-4-17**] 07:10AM BLOOD WBC-9.0 RBC-3.91* Hgb-10.8* Hct-34.5*\nMCV-88 MCH-27.7 MCHC-31.4 RDW-14.6 Plt Ct-330\n[**2141-4-15**] 06:31AM BLOOD PT-11.1 PTT-27.1 INR(PT)-1.0\n[**2141-4-17**] 07:10AM BLOOD Glucose-100 UreaN-9 Creat-0.7 Na-125*\nK-4.6 Cl-93* HCO3-24 AnGap-13\n[**2141-4-15**] 06:31AM BLOOD CK-MB-4 cTropnT-0.07*\n[**2141-4-14**] 09:50PM BLOOD CK-MB-3 cTropnT-0.07*\n[**2141-4-14**] 11:10AM BLOOD cTropnT-0.04*\n\nBrief Hospital Course:\n[**Age over 90 **] female with h\/o HTN, HLD, recent NSTEMI, and sCHF (45-50%)\npresented to [**Hospital1 **] [**Location (un) 620**] with UA, transferred for c. cath\nshowing significant left main and LAD disease s\/p BMSx2 with\ntransient hypotension\/bradycardia during procedure attributed to\ncatheter placement.\n.\n# CAD\nPatient had NSTEMI that was medically managed a week prior to\nadmission.  She presented again with chest pain consistent with\nunstable angina, associated with ECG changes and borderline\ncardiac biomarkers.  She was started on heparin and\nnitroglycerin infusion and transferred to [**Hospital1 18**].  After\ndiscussions with her family, a cardiac catheterization was\nperformed revealing significant left main and LAD disease.  Two\nBMS were placed in the left circumflex ostial occlusion with\ncollaterals.  The patient had transient hypotension\/bradycardiac\nduring her procedure attributed to catheter placement.  She was\nmonitored in the CCU after and her vital signs remained stable.\nShe is to continue ASA 325 mg indefinitely and will require\nplavix 75 mg daily for at least 1 month, but preferably for 12\nmonths.  She was continued on metoprolol with a goal heart rate\nof 60-70.  She was also continued on lisinopril and started on\natorvastatin for optimal medical management.  She remained chest\npain free during her stay.\n.\n# Acute on chronic systolic heart failure (Most recent EF\n45-50%)\nPt was recently discharged from [**Hospital1 **]-Neeham with a documented\nweight of 112 lbs (50.9 kg).  She had recently been started on\nlasix, lisinopril and spironolactone.  She did not appear\novertly fluid overloaded on admission, and her admission weight\nwas 107.8 lbs (49 kgs).  Her admission CXR revealed some\nevidence of mild-moderate pulmonary edema, which may reflect\ndiastolic dysfunction from demand ischemia.  Her I\/O were\nmonitoered and she was weighed daily.  Lasix and spironoloactone\nwere held.  A repeat TTE revealed Normal left ventricular cavity\nsize with mild regional systolic dysfunction c\/w CAD (PDA\ndistribution).\n.\n# RHYTHM:\nThe patient has known paroxysmal AF, but was in NSR upon\nadmission. The morning of [**4-16**], she was noted to be in atrial\nfibrillation with rapid ventricular response.  She was\nhemodynamically stable.  She was given metoprolol 5 mg IV x2\nwith out a significant drop in her heart rate.  She was then\nloaded with amiodarone (initially IV, later transitioned to po\nwhen she converted back to sinus).  She remained in NSR\nthroughout the rest of her hospital course and is to continue on\namiodarone upon discharge.\n.\n# Hyponatremia\nThe patient's admission Na was 127, and initially thought to be\nsecondary to intravascular volume depletion with non-osmotic\nrelease of ADH given active usage of diuretic regimen.\nHer sodium continued to trend down.  Urine electrolytes were\nconsistent with diuresis leading to hyponatremia.\nHer fluids were restricted and she was given small boluses of\nIVF given likely hypovolemia.  Her sodium stabilized to 125.\n.\n# HTN\nThe patient was continued on her home metoprolol and lisinopril.\n As above, her furosemide and spironolactone here held.  She\nremained normotensive throughout her CCU and floor stay.\n.\n# HLD\nHer most recent lipid panel ([**2141-4-8**]) revealed good lipid\ncontrol (chol 134, TG 57, HDL 71, LDL 43).  She was continued on\natorvastatin 80 mg given her ACS.\n.\n# Left subclavian stenosis\nHer BP was monitored on her right arm.  This should be monitored\nas an outpatient.\n.\n# History of fasting glucose intolerance\nHer most recent HbA1c was 6.2 on [**2141-4-7**].

Because\nof this procedure, it will be extremely important to follow-up\nwith your primary doctor and to establish care with a\ncardiologist.  You should also continue to take your medications\nexactly as prescribed to prevent complications.\n.\nYou were also found to have a low sodium level, which was\nprobably due to being dehydrated.  Because of this, you should\nSTOP taking your water pills (diuretics, called lasix).  It will\nbe very important to have labs checked with your primary doctor,\nand to discuss whether to re-start your water pills at your\nfollow-up appointment\n.\nPlease note the following medication changes:\n-STOP taking lasix and spironolactone (the water pills) until\nyou speak with your primary doctor at your follow-up appointment\n.\n-STOP taking metoprolol TARTRATE and\n-START taking metoprolol SUCCINATE\n.\n-START taking plavix\n-START taking Aspirin 325mg daily\n-START taking atorvastatin 80mg daily\n-START taking amiodarone 200mg twice daily with meals for 1\nmonth.
